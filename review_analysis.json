                "text": "Intel's Evo platform standards, which emphasizes features like fast wake times, long battery life, and high performance:1- Good Battery Backup: laptop has a long-lasting battery, which is a key feature of Intel Evo-certified devices.2- Fast Boot-up: The quick startup suggests that the laptop utilizes fast storage technology, such as SSDs, to boot up quickly.3- Good Performance: As an Evo-certified laptop, it's expected to deliver solid performance, likely powered by a high-performance CPU and GPU.4- Awesome Camera Quality:laptop likely has a high-quality webcam, which is important for video conferencing and streaming.5- Clear Audio with Dolby Sound: The inclusion of Dolby sound suggests that the laptop offers high-quality audio output, enhancing the multimedia experience.6- OLED Display for Good Clarity: OLED displays typically offer vibrant colors and deep blacks, providing excellent clarity and contrast for visual content.Overall, a laptop with these features would likely offer a premium computing experience suitable for a range of tasks, from productivity to multimedia consumption and content creation.;Review after 4 Months of usage. I am thoroughly impressed. The performance delivered by the Intel Evo Core Ultra 9 185H processor and the Intel Arc GPU is exceptional, handling intensive tasks with ease. The 14\" 2.8K-OLED display is a visual treat, offering vibrant colors and sharp details at a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. The laptop's build quality is top-notch, and it feels sturdy yet lightweight at just 1.4kg.The addition of built-in AI features enhances productivity, making tasks feel more intuitive. With 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD, multitasking and storage are a breeze. The FHD+ IR Camera ensures clear video calls, and the one-year ADP free service is a nice bonus. Overall, the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 excels in both performance and quality, making it a worthwhile investment.Applications used;If any problem comes. Amazon is worst than any retail shop. The app just keeps going in circle when you try to connect with customer service. From the internet I somehow connected to their customer service. But I felt sorry for them as they don't have any clear instructions. Lenovo gave a DOA and seal packed the laptop. More than three weeks now. I am left with DOA and seal packed laptop. My money is struck and no laptop to use.;After getting white screen innmy iphone 13 pro after 17.5.1 update I wanted to tell bye bye for apple products . So I was searching replacement for my macbook pro  since last 3 weeks . After researching a lot this one felt like a good choice in every aspects , display , performance, gaming .Having core ultra 9 is very good for any task , Intel arc graphics is integrated , but it's equivalent to 4gb graphics of 3050 series and pretty good . 32 gb ram is all enough for anything. First time in my life I never heard fan sound when Android studio running with emulator, which shows how good this laptop is in terms of performance. Played couple of games via game pass I got and they were good , but size of games are like 129 gb and all , that was surprising to me as I played games in laptop after years . But 1 tb SSD is all enough to have such 5 games . Battery life came 7 hours for me for mixed usage . As a security professional running kali linux in virtual box was very smooth and I didn't expect so much good performance for the price . So it's value for money. As by combining offers I got it around 86 k . It have amazing display and brightness, which even beats so called retina displays  . Totally satisfied with the choice i made.;The laptop has good build quality with full metal body, looks slik and professional much like Mac. I will go as far as calling it the Lenovo's MacBook.\ud83d\ude04 The display is fairly, would have been best if we did not get a lot of glare and reflection. Display is bright.However there are some minor cons are there to take away the 5th star. Heating is an issue with all laptops from this segment and this is not an exception, they did cost cut through build quality of Touch Pad and keyboard, the quality of both feels cheap. Last is the sound, well, don't expect much buy a good quality earphone.;I\u2019ve been using this laptop for a few weeks now, and I\u2019m thoroughly impressed with its performance! From the moment I powered it on, everything runs incredibly smooth. The speed is remarkable, whether I\u2019m multitasking with multiple apps, editing large files, or even gaming. The processor handles everything I throw at it without any signs of slowing down.The display is stunning\u2014sharp and vibrant, which makes working for long hours much easier on the eyes. Battery life is also a pleasant surprise, lasting me through a full day of heavy use without needing to recharge constantly. And the design? Sleek and modern, making it perfect for both work and play.Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a laptop that delivers in terms of speed, performance, and looks, this is an excellent choice. Definitely worth every penny! Highly recommended.;Given the configuration it is the best laptop. Performance is Excellent. Weight is light. I loved the Sound Quality. Ease of use. Boots within the blink of eye. The Build Quality is excellent. Original Product.;I checked a Asus Zenbook, and Vivobook models before finalizing on this model. The display is excellent, the CPU is top tier, and the form factor is perfect for portability. On a light to heavy workload I got about 4-5 hours of battery life. I ran about 4 VMs on VMWare Workstation, and still it stayed around 75-80 Deg. C. The build quality is good. This laptop, with a Intel Evo Core Ultra 9 185H is good value for money, esp. when the competition sells for more than 1.5L",

I got it for 39k with bank office in great Indian sales and satisfied with it.;The product I received has issues with both hardware and software. The hardware is not functioning properly, and the software is also problematic. Additionally, the system is not working smoothly as expected. Please address these issues and provide a solution at the earliest.;battery drains fast runs only for 3.5 hrperformance is good but after 6-7 hrs of continuous use for study starts to lag and does not loadbuy for 32k through credit card and exchange offerotherwise don't  buy;After using it for a day -Display : pretty goodSpeakers - Below averageBattery life - GoodCamera - GoodPerformed well in dead pixel and keyboard functionality test.Overall amazing laptop for the price .....;Does my job without any hiccups.

This is unacceptable.Why does Amazon allow such defective products to be sold? Lenovo should be ashamed for still keeping this outdated and dysfunctional product on the market. This device should be discontinued immediately. It seems like Lenovo is simply clearing old stock and exploiting customers.Since this government came into power, fraud and substandard products are everywhere. I won\u2019t let this slide I will file a serious complaint and pursue this matter until this product is taken back and refunded.;The media could not be loaded.Just received the product,gotta say it's looking and working good for the price range,touch is good, applications are good.i ordered it just to watch movies and do random stuff,will update about it after a week of use plus the delivery was early which is a good thing;Overall Great product Screen is good for study purpose watching movies yt etc also battery backup is good about 8-9 hours on full charge and Charging speed is fine not too fast overall best product no lag in daily usage  All apps work fine;Hey, I received the tablet on time. Then I use this product . The product is good and osam in performance. I can use this tablet and the picture quality and work experience is good . The tablet fulfill the price range . The tablet battery is osam in use;Best product in cheap price full paisa vasool;Received a damaged product. Totally dead.It's not getting charged. I would suggest don't buy as company as well as amazon people not responding. Company has only one showroom for service centre in Mumbai. I called service centre they asked me to registered the warranty and then only something can be done. Pls don't buy;Excellent great\ud83d\udc4d",

Despite being refurbished, the laptop arrived in excellent condition and looks almost brand new. Performance-wise, it\u2019s incredibly fast and runs smoothly, handling multitasking with ease. The 16GB DDR4 RAM and 512GB SSD contribute to seamless operations, and Windows 11 enhances the overall user experience. Battery life is outstanding, providing long-lasting backup for work and entertainment. For anyone looking for a reliable, high-performance laptop at a great value, this is an excellent choice!;I received a non-functional (dead) laptop. While the physical condition appeared satisfactory, the device does not power on. The Caps Lock and power buttons are flashing, indicating an issue. Upon contacting the seller's support, I was instructed to send the laptop to Bangalore for repairs, after which it would be returned to me. Amazon's customer support also declined to accept a return, citing a lack of stock for replacement. Instead, they proposed sending a technician to resolve the issue.This entire process has been an incredibly frustrating experience. Why should a buyer endure such inconvenience for a defective product?I strongly advise against purchasing refurbished products from Amazon, as it may lead to unnecessary hassles.It is far better to buy from a local vendor, even if it means spending a bit more, as the peace of mind is worth it.;Received in good condition, and also got support from recyclekart team. Function , display and other things ok. Looks little old. But obviously it's pre owned, so accepted.;The Laptop Lenovo laptop offers a good balance of performance and portability. Battery life is average but sufficient for most users. The build quality feels sturdy, though it could be lighter. Overall, it\u2019s a reliable choice for students and professionals who need a decent laptop for everyday use. It's in good condition must buy ..;Initially the product was deliver with broken charger after communicating the problem with seller they promised to send the power cable only (after lot of argument) but it has been a month they have have not sent the power  cable...2nd thing after using the product (after purchasing charger of  my own)for a  week some cracks started to develope on the left side after few days  cracks developed all over the base plate and now  breaking into small peices .when i contact  the seller  after a lot of argument the are asking to send the laptop back to them (though they have a service centre in nehru place  delhi but saying send it to gujrat they have main branch in gujrat )for repair and they are not even taking the responsibility of any loss during transportationWorst quality product and worst seller rude he even cuts the call without solving my concern ..never buy a product from them kedia interprises;After Use of product for One month,  I can write it's Performance:-Function of this product very good, But saying to update apps one week.Battery life is about 3-4 hours.Keyboard quality is very goodValue for money, just like it very much.Easy to use.Thanks for this product.;Very worst product.  The same has not worked from last 20 days.  We have shown the laptop in Visakhapatnam authorised LENOVO Service Center.  They said you have purchased refurbished laptop in online we cannot provide service under warranty.  We have paid Rs.885/- for fist time checkup.  And against 2 days after laptop got repaired and went to service center.  They said mother board not working, you may contact amazon online help number.  Please advise us for further process to get my laptop in working condition.;The Laptop is good, performance is good. Had issue with the touchpad it was not working properly not an Issue. I had reached the customer care of Newjaisa and immediately they had ordered the spare and received in a couple of days. The part received is working fine and I had replaced myself. It is worth to have I7 8th gen,16 GB and 512 Gb SSD. The battery health is also fine for this Range. It had two batteries, One external and one internal.  The external battery capacity is 19200/24050 and Internal Health is 11500/23940. No heating issues, The screen display is great.

The sound had a better bass than other tab speakers (not like portable speaker bass, but is much better and cleaner to listen music, movies)2. Screen is good. The blacks and colours are better than normal TFT displays.3. Android Support assured - Lenovo assures updates till Android 16 (2 years) and support till mid 2028 in the product description.4. The stand - unique design. Useful for video calls, watching movies.5. Proper 45 watt charger in box.Other than this, from the improvement side, I felt camera (front) is better on Samsung A9 plus - but a very slight difference. The clarity / resolution of both are similar - only colours look a bit nicer in A9. Also, based on earlier reviews read - applied a screen guard on the day one itself.;This tab is exclusively designed for playing media. 8 JBL speakers produce brilliant sound. The bass ,treble and tweeter reproduce sound faithfully. This also features sound modes with equalizers for preferred sound output. This comes with Dolby Atmos with 3 modes, dynamic, movie and music. Music mode comes with 4 configurable options, namely none,detailed,balanced and warm. The equalizer comes with 10 band from 47 Hz to 13 KHz. Tinny sound normally heard in tablets is absent.The tablet's 2K resolution is good for watching movies. Kick stand is a good feature and is sturdy. Tablet comes with Android 14 out of the box with 2 years OS upgrade.Battery 8600 mAh is sufficient and will last a good 5 days with 30 minutes of video playback with 45 W charger for fast charging. Comes with USB C cable to be used for data and charging. Don't expect performance in gaming. This is designed as an all round performer focussing mainly on multimedia playback.8Gb LPDDR4X memory is enough for multitasking and 128 Gb UFS 2.2 storage is sufficient and fast. A micro SD slot at the top supports 1 Tb.Tactile response is good with smooth scrolling. Apps open quick and clean.Those seeking cellular network should not buy this as this has only WiFi. This supports pen and wireless keyboard to be bought separately.This can be used as a boom box,soundbar through bluetoothTo sum up, a good product delivering expected overall performance and excellent in audio department.Highly recommended for media buffs;I purchased it from amazon. Perfirmance is good and value for money. Design is unique and speaker quality is awesome. Perfect tab for entertainment, study and some level of official work.After a week of usePerformance wise good. I tested bgmi game and working fine.Heating not detected yet.. battory is sufficient for a day.Briteness is little low in day time. Overall hardware and quality wise good.;I wasn't expecting this much from Lenovo. Was inclined towards OnePlus tab, but this indeed a great tab.Superb clear screen, jbl speakers are outstanding. 8 GB comes + 5 GB ram extension available. Android 16 upgrade is promised.I connected Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, it worked breeze. The moment you connect mouse keyboard it prompts to switch to workstation mode and works like a PC. Very happy with the purchase. Also comes with 45W charger, charging speed it good.;The media could not be loaded.Overall its good tablet at this price range. But i have observed some issue with this tab.1. No gallary option is provided i used google gallary2. Netflix is crashed many times i hope it will improve after update.3. screen is not upto the mark.4. Sometime its lag due to low end processor so avoid playing games.Good points-1.Speaker is tooo good. you wont regrate if you buy this for entertainment purpose.2. PC mode is fantastic in this laptop most of my office work and attending meeting i used this laptop.3. Design is very good you dont feel uncomfortable while holding this tab.4. Fast charging and battery backup is good on this laptop.;The speaker is epic. But the processor isnt really that good as it lagged for a min in the first hour and then it was fine. It's a good tab. Charges faster than expected. 1 important thing is that my warranty had only 309 days left, not 365. That's one issue I'm still trying to get fixed. I'll keep updating it in the future.;OK, so my basic need was to edit documents on the go, installed office 365, and it works just perfect, no lags or sluggishness.Display is just good, could have been better with anti glare coating.45 watt Charger is quite fast, takes around 1.5 hours, doesn't heat during charging and simultaneous usage. Haven't checked standby charging speed, it might be faster though.Cameras are just fine, back camera is not meant for photography though, front camera is better than my Dell Inspiron 7572 for video conferencing. Cameras are good in low light conditions.It's seems heavy, yes, quite heavy and slippery, so better get a folio with tablet, else it might slip out of hands easily.And.... \ud83e\udd14 What else?Speakers, yeah, that's the strength of this tab, I had no idea that a boombox is there inside. Sound is loud and perfect, it surpasses Moto Z speaker mod at sound, even surpasses my Laptop speakers, comparable to TV. Audio quality is great if you have knowledge of equalizer.Wifi is stable and works even at distanceBattery backup is also good, drops at a rate of 3% per hour with full blown speakers and display onWhat else? Yes, I miss 4G or 5G slot, had it been there this would have been a complete package.Anyways, go for it if you can compromise on SIM slot.",

                "text": "The media could not be loaded.Reviewing  after 1 month of usages!! First I'm confused about this laptop because of the negative review ,it's a great laptop for basic use & for professionals.Pros--The build quality is good \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb,- the design is very sleek smooth- keyboard quality and keys are good, \u263a\ufe0f-Processor is beast very much satisfied ,-Battery life is also average max 4 hr to 5 hr depends on usages ,- lenovo service is so good I can say cause I noticed that my touchpad is sometimes lagging(coz of BIOS not uptodate) so I connect with the support team in lenovo offical website , he fixed it in just 10 mins! \u263a\ufe0fCONS-  Brightness is bit low have to set in 80 to100 range- speaker sound is average!- while charging the heating issue felt but not very much- only 60hrz refresh rate not satisfied- sometimes  display wombling not much but little- backlit light is  dim.Overall it'a good laptop \u2665\ufe0f 4.5/5If your priority is  not gaming or editingthen you can go for it! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb;Almost using it for 5 days :-Pros :- \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d.) Build quality\ud83d\udca5.) Display worth the money.) Battery life - I got 7.5 hrs with normal usage ( offline movies + YouTube + Browsing + Pdf reading) with Wifi and Bluetooth turned on all the time...I kept brightness at 30% ( since It is sufficient for me in indoors ) and in dark mode...Another time I got only 5.5 hrs of battery life...so not sure of the exact battery span..) Flip to start is very useful.) Booting time is only 10-15 secs max.) Performance is good for this budget.) Light weight and very convenient to use especially for studyingCons :- \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e.) Heating issue while charging\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8.) Sometimes it heats up even with normal usage.) Speaker is good but sound is low.) Missing fingerprint sensor/Facial recognition in this rangeTips :-.) Don't charge immediately after using for more hours...let the heat to cool down and then charge.) After charging let the heat to cool down..then start to use ( will Increase battery span )Product got delivered b4 the due date...and packaging was good \ud83d\udc4dConclusion : Simply go for it if you are a student and doesn't play that much of games\ud83d\udca5;Lightweight, good quality, high performance, good battery life and fast charging. I brought before 4 months and used for high performance programming. Over all its worth buying and truly made for developers.;I bought this laptop few days back. There was an issue with the screen so I had to return/replace it. The amazon guys has been lying from start. They said they were going to initiate a lenovo technician visit. I waited for 2 days, no one came so I called lenovo directly. They said they had no notification regarding any booking of technician visit.Once I booked the technician visit in lenovo's side a visit was arranged. In the meantime amazon kept telling me that their hands are tied as long as the product is not sealed by lenovo. Once lenoco technician checks the project and gives no objection for return we will return/replace it immediately. Now it has been almost 2 weeks, everyday a return is created and gets cancelled saying the product was not ready when actually no one visited.My biggest mistake was to buy it from amazon. The laptop is actually good. But directly from lenovo or may ve croma.;It's very slim , The build is plastic but it's very tough , the display is FHD and it's a good display, The processer is actually a beast but you need to use it on charging to utilise it's full capacity , battery backup despite of having a H series processor and 48W Battery it performs very well and give you a 5hr screen on time the sound isn't too loud but if you keep it on your lap or so then you won't face any issue , And the main keypoint of this laptop is it's i7 13gen processor which is very very powerful but remember it has a intel UHD graphics so you are not going to play any graphics involving games it won't be a smooth experience overall a good product for real;Great product. Got it for 43k so a sweet purchase.Few cons:No Type-C Charging \u2013 This is the biggest letdown.No Fingerprint Sensor \u2013 At this price point (60k), it's a noticeable omission.Can't Be Opened with One Hand \u2013 Not a dealbreaker, but it would have been a nice touch.Lid Feels a Bit Fragile \u2013 Possibly due to being too tight, making the lid feel delicate when opening.;Within 15 hours I got product after ordered, product build quality is very poor. You will not feel satisfaction after 56K spend. Other body quality is very poor and all core are sharp.Performance wise good because very hi fi processor and RAM.I will not recommend if you searching good and attractive body quality and  robust Laptop.;Have been using this for more than a month now.Everything about this laptop is perfect, The processor combines high power efficiency along with great performance, giving this laptop a good battery backup.16 GB ram is adequate and it can handle multitasking very well. The laptop starts up very quickly thanks to the SSD used.Design and finishing is perfect. Would recommend this to others.",

Big yes !(Better than Ausus, HP, sorry not sorry but all my families use different laptop that's much pricier than this laptop but it outperforms ausus vivobook, hp)Cons :\u2022 Not for heavy gaming as it drains quiet fast when you play games on it ( on 100% it drained quiet fast when I played DOTA)\u2022 Bluetooth tend to stop working when you're using a wireless mouse/keyboard and Bluetooth earbuds both connected to the laptop (you have to disconnect either the ear buds or the mouse)Camera : TRASH (Sorry not sorry)Conclusion: Dont play heavy games, good for academic works ( if you're not a developer don't stress on it but learn python at the least lol )Should you buy it ?Yes, if it's well within your budget(It's better than vivobook :D);I bought this Lenovo Ideapad laptop 3 months ago and after use of less than 2 months battery is not taking charge. I called the Amazon customer care they told me to contact Lenovo customer care for support. And when I called Lenovo customer care they checked the laptop virtually by taker controls from Rescue Lens application and found that there is a issue with battery. And after 3-4 days one of their technician come to replace the battery and after replacing the battery issue still remains same. Then he troubleshooted and told us that its motherboard having issues so they have to replace motherboard. I asked them to replace full unit but they are denying. I again called the customer care of lenovo but they are denying to replace the unit. Also, when I bought this unit I found that the warranty on site shows expired. I think these lenovo company guys are so unprofessional and there is no management and quality check of the products.  At last I want to say please dont buy this product its unreliable.....Its waste of money.;Works excellentHas all featuresBattery works for good 5-6 hours on continuous working and watching video.Very smooth and sleek.Value for money.;;It doesn't have backlit keyboard but the device performance is efficient. Loads windows under 10 secs and no log observed so far. The sound quality is really good.;Every thing is good but you can not control blacklit keyboard intensity light. You can just turn it on or off. You can't change it to low, medium and high. And fingerprint senseor is not compatible for the hello window is showing.Good pointsPerformance is goodBattery is goodBad pointsYou can't ajust the light of keyboard.

So yeah again normal-normal.Hardware is top notch, the keyboard quality is good.So all in all it is very good laptop, it will get all your normal needs done, go for it ,you will get it in 45k in sale.;Light weight easy to carry, good processor for day to day office work with home 11 and Ms office pre installed. Screen brightness is decent indoor but speaker is pathetic so not recommended for multimedia use case. If you want a laptop for office work with low budget below 50k go for it. I got it for 39k with bank office in great Indian sales and satisfied with it.;The product I received has issues with both hardware and software. The hardware is not functioning properly, and the software is also problematic. Additionally, the system is not working smoothly as expected. Please address these issues and provide a solution at the earliest.;battery drains fast runs only for 3.5 hrperformance is good but after 6-7 hrs of continuous use for study starts to lag and does not loadbuy for 32k through credit card and exchange offerotherwise don't  buy;After using it for a day -Display : pretty goodSpeakers - Below averageBattery life - GoodCamera - GoodPerformed well in dead pixel and keyboard functionality test.Overall amazing laptop for the price .....;Does my job without any hiccups. Happy with the purchase.;Quality and functionality is smooth.Seems best product and got it for 40k during the sale.Battery life is good.Camera quality and sound is just Ok.",

I have been using this since October 2024 ,good battery,display and stylus is a huge help.;The media could not be loaded.A great experience using the TAB since I purchased. Only drawback is the touch response from the Pen provided. Battery life around 10K would have been great. Very sleek in design. Dolby Atmos sound gives great hearing experience. The 3mm audio port is placed at the corner is little awkward - should have been placed in the middle. Touch sensitivity was smooth. Performance is great. Very less heat generated even after prolonged usage. Scrolling speed and quality is great. Brightness is good. More shortcut options required in System control area. Would recommend for students and casual users at this reasonable price point. Would rate this product at 4/5 in overall.;This is the best table for animation in 20000\u20b9 and call of duty mobile was given 60 to 80 fps and battery life is good if you use full fledg it will come a complete day and sound quality is top notchand display quality is very good at this price point weight off it is light and touch functional is good feels like butterAnd multitasking is goodI am saying it after a month of use;The item I received had a defective USB port, Amazon couldn't help, return period got over, Lenovo does not respond to complaints. Humble suggestion to anyone - Not just this tablet, don't buy any electronic items from Amazon. If product runs smooth, great. In case there is a problem, amazon has no support system. They will say 'they directly can't change the item, you please raise a ticket with the manufacturer'. The manufacturer NEVER responds. Your return period window gets over. Then you are left with warranty period. I'm still struggling even to get a response from Lenovo for raising warranty claim. It has been months now. Don't buy such items from Amazon, instead buy from shops. You may pay some extra bucks, but you don't have to worry on returns / warranty claims in case of any issue.;Best budget tab for students. Palm rejection works perfectly.;The display, sound, look&feel at this budget is wonderful. I am happy for content watch, online meeting/class, reading pdfs, taking notes with the pen and some digital drawings too...all perfect.But as I am paying just 13k, I have to experince some wait-time, say when opening youtube or lag when the video appears. It needs bit patience. If some Lag is OK for you go for it, I don't see any other cons.;No doubt product is fantastic. User interface provides very friendly environment. Battery backup is also good. Sound quality clarity and volume everything is very good.The only draw back to have Lenovo product is to look for its service centre. They are very difficult to fetch. There very less or no service centre. You can't find them before Delhi.;Price good but feels some lag when notification come at down it lags like old TVs and takes long time to go. IF you searching for study purpose tablet go for it the pen was also good but showed me battery drain problem so I ordered the battery's but now there is no issue and I didn't inserted the battery.

                "text": "The product is a good one. Very good value for its price. The positives are:1. Speakers - Very good. Clear even at max volume. The sound had a better bass than other tab speakers (not like portable speaker bass, but is much better and cleaner to listen music, movies)2. Screen is good. The blacks and colours are better than normal TFT displays.3. Android Support assured - Lenovo assures updates till Android 16 (2 years) and support till mid 2028 in the product description.4. The stand - unique design. Useful for video calls, watching movies.5. Proper 45 watt charger in box.Other than this, from the improvement side, I felt camera (front) is better on Samsung A9 plus - but a very slight difference. The clarity / resolution of both are similar - only colours look a bit nicer in A9. Also, based on earlier reviews read - applied a screen guard on the day one itself.;This tab is exclusively designed for playing media. 8 JBL speakers produce brilliant sound. The bass ,treble and tweeter reproduce sound faithfully. This also features sound modes with equalizers for preferred sound output. This comes with Dolby Atmos with 3 modes, dynamic, movie and music. Music mode comes with 4 configurable options, namely none,detailed,balanced and warm. The equalizer comes with 10 band from 47 Hz to 13 KHz. Tinny sound normally heard in tablets is absent.The tablet's 2K resolution is good for watching movies. Kick stand is a good feature and is sturdy. Tablet comes with Android 14 out of the box with 2 years OS upgrade.Battery 8600 mAh is sufficient and will last a good 5 days with 30 minutes of video playback with 45 W charger for fast charging. Comes with USB C cable to be used for data and charging. Don't expect performance in gaming. This is designed as an all round performer focussing mainly on multimedia playback.8Gb LPDDR4X memory is enough for multitasking and 128 Gb UFS 2.2 storage is sufficient and fast. A micro SD slot at the top supports 1 Tb.Tactile response is good with smooth scrolling. Apps open quick and clean.Those seeking cellular network should not buy this as this has only WiFi. This supports pen and wireless keyboard to be bought separately.This can be used as a boom box,soundbar through bluetoothTo sum up, a good product delivering expected overall performance and excellent in audio department.Highly recommended for media buffs;I purchased it from amazon. Perfirmance is good and value for money. Design is unique and speaker quality is awesome. Perfect tab for entertainment, study and some level of official work.After a week of usePerformance wise good. I tested bgmi game and working fine.Heating not detected yet.. battory is sufficient for a day.Briteness is little low in day time. Overall hardware and quality wise good.;I wasn't expecting this much from Lenovo. Was inclined towards OnePlus tab, but this indeed a great tab.Superb clear screen, jbl speakers are outstanding. 8 GB comes + 5 GB ram extension available. Android 16 upgrade is promised.I connected Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, it worked breeze. The moment you connect mouse keyboard it prompts to switch to workstation mode and works like a PC. Very happy with the purchase. Also comes with 45W charger, charging speed it good.;The media could not be loaded.Overall its good tablet at this price range. But i have observed some issue with this tab.1. No gallary option is provided i used google gallary2. Netflix is crashed many times i hope it will improve after update.3. screen is not upto the mark.4. Sometime its lag due to low end processor so avoid playing games.Good points-1.Speaker is tooo good. you wont regrate if you buy this for entertainment purpose.2. PC mode is fantastic in this laptop most of my office work and attending meeting i used this laptop.3. Design is very good you dont feel uncomfortable while holding this tab.4. Fast charging and battery backup is good on this laptop.;The speaker is epic. But the processor isnt really that good as it lagged for a min in the first hour and then it was fine. It's a good tab. Charges faster than expected. 1 important thing is that my warranty had only 309 days left, not 365. That's one issue I'm still trying to get fixed. I'll keep updating it in the future.;OK, so my basic need was to edit documents on the go, installed office 365, and it works just perfect, no lags or sluggishness.Display is just good, could have been better with anti glare coating.45 watt Charger is quite fast, takes around 1.5 hours, doesn't heat during charging and simultaneous usage. Haven't checked standby charging speed, it might be faster though.Cameras are just fine, back camera is not meant for photography though, front camera is better than my Dell Inspiron 7572 for video conferencing. Cameras are good in low light conditions.It's seems heavy, yes, quite heavy and slippery, so better get a folio with tablet, else it might slip out of hands easily.And.... \ud83e\udd14 What else?Speakers, yeah, that's the strength of this tab, I had no idea that a boombox is there inside. Sound is loud and perfect, it surpasses Moto Z speaker mod at sound, even surpasses my Laptop speakers, comparable to TV. Audio quality is great if you have knowledge of equalizer.Wifi is stable and works even at distanceBattery backup is also good, drops at a rate of 3% per hour with full blown speakers and display onWhat else? Yes, I miss 4G or 5G slot, had it been there this would have been a complete package.Anyways, go for it if you can compromise on SIM slot.",

                "text": "Great laptop wonderful performance UI is very friendly design in so unique smoothness is  wow battery is ok and weight is very surpriseing heavy;Edit:DONT BE FOOLED BY 2 RAM SLOTSIT CAN TAKE A MAX IF 16GB RAM. SO THE ONLY UPGRADE POSSIBLE FOR THE 1x16GB MODEL IS CHANGING IT TO DUAL CHANNEL 2x8GB.Found out the hard and sad way, also confirmed with Lenovo.Old:The other review covers it very well, it will run whatever you throw at it.I left Red Dead Redemption 2 running for 20 hours straight. resumed playing still ran like butter.It comes with 2nd NVME slot but no screw so you'll have to procure it separately.Others count lack of RGB as a con, but I'll say White looks professional, wich goes with the overall look of the laptop, making it suitable for use in professional environments if you don't want everyone around you knowing you're a gamer.not being able to charge via the USB C is understandable with 170 W in the adaptor.90W TDP is boost TPG it will show lower but boosts it to 90W. remains cool without throttling even for longer heavy workloads, hint 20hours of RDR2.I recommend buying a 2nd NVME along with your purchase as you'll run out of 500 gigs quick.The included disk is a WD BLue SN530, not the best but good performance, not something you'll find slow in your daily usage unless your work is copying > 200 gig everyday.2Gig of the 16GB included ram go to VRAM .;I bought the 24gb ram, i7 13th nvidia 4050 version. The performance is stellar. I enabled windows ultimate performance in power management options from cmd. I also updated the bios using Lenovo website as the system was prompting the same. The gaming is butter smooth. Temperature management is also very good. I take breaks between 1.5 hour rounds by shutting off the computer when the fan noise peaks. Easily a powerhorse. Lenovo vantage is also very useful in managing power requirements and fan noise. Be sure to remove the paper cover on the charger and keep the charger standing on the long edge/side. Being a laptop it is also advisable to play on full charge with plugged on set up. Keyboard and trackpad are also very very professional. Display is ok ok. For 94000 this is a good gaming plus professional laptop.;I bought this laptop and upon  100% charging,  it gets drained within 3 hours if laptop remains idle, drains within one and half hour if you are watching a YouTube video or using multiple excel files. If you are playing games then it barely lasts till an hour. Very very bad battery life. It is complete waste of money.;Bought it for price 78k on December 2023. Have been using it for 8 months.Most of the modern AAA titles run at 1080p 60fps.The screen refresh rate is 165Hz, which if bought separately costs a lot.The CPU has 8 cores and 16 Threads, which is enough for any programming, rendering, compilation or virtualization.The Ryzen 7 5800H also has a RX Vega 8 APU graphics which can be used for encoding while streaming, while your main game runs on RTX 3060I have tested linux on it as well, after disabling secure boot, and installing Nvidia drivers for Nvidia optimus also works and is hassle free.The only cons might be both the USB ports being on the right side. And the battery-life, but that is to be expected of any gaming laptop.;So this is my second gaming laptop, first one being the Legion Y520 (i5 7th gen, GTX 1050). That laptop lasted 6 years for me and is currently being used by my sister.Few reasons why I opted for this laptop in particular:CPU and GPU combination - Ryzen 7 5800H, RTX 3060 @90W TDPDisplay - 165Hz, 100% SRGBPrice: Got it for 89,990Originally I wanted the MSI Alpha 15 Advantage edition that has the same CPU, but comes with 8GB Radeon 6600M. It was slightly expensive and delivery by Flipkart was quite slow for my address, so I didn't go for it. There were 2 other options from MSI that have RTX 3060 and shipped with i7 CPU, but they did not have color accurate displays (45% color gamut). For these reasons Ideapad gaming 3 became the perfect pick for me and I am impressed with my purchase. Boot times are of course great and games load significantly fast, of course. I am planning to  add a 1TB SSD and additional 16GB RAM later which will improve the performance even further!Following games have been tested by me so far on ultra to medium settings:World of Warships - average FPS 100-120 @ ultra settingsWitcher 3 - 60 FPS on ultra settings. For some reason the FPS for this game are locked at 60A Plague Tale: Innocence - 90-120 FPS on medium to ultra settingsForza Horizon 4 -  did not have FPS enable at that time so could not see the actual FPS, but it looked great so I'll assume it was in the range mentioned aboveI am planning to try out more games and will update my review accordingly. But so far I am happy with my purchase and can recommend this laptop to future buyers with confidence. Trackpad is quite awesome too,  don't know though which driver it is using. Keyboard is great as well, but I use an external keyboard anyway so it does not matter to me. Speakers are satisfactory. They are placed at the bottom and deliver good sound both in terms of quality and loudness.The device is surprisingly lightweight which is a good thing! Build quality could have been better, but it is definitely not fragile. Keyboard is white backlit only, so no RGB lighting available. I am not into the fancy RGB lighting so it does not bother me at all. I am also thankful that it does not come with red lighting on the keyboard!Thank you Amazon for quick delivery (16 hours) and thank you Lenovo for this good product.Edit: I forgot the mention that I played for three hours straight and did not experience any kind of performance throttling. Boot up is almost instant which is expected. Note that it comes with 1x 16GB RAM and my laptop came with WD SN530 SSD. You have one more slot for RAM and SSD each and I've read somewhere that the laptop can support NVMe Gen 4 SSDs, but not sure whether that's true.;It is a damn good and very nice price laptop.People were saying that it has battery drain issue, but I found it good. The Battery lasts around 5hrs in normal work including photoshop. The body is strong, design is good. I loved the display.I was confused between the Infinix one and this one, but this one is much better as Lenovo has broader service area.",

Size and weight is not too much. All together it is value for money.;The media could not be loaded.Using it for a month and a halfPros:16gb ram is a wise choice for a coder.Screen Quality is good (Don't know why there were a lot of negative reviews about it), Genuine Windows 11 and MS office (great for students and content creators),Lightweight, easy and fast.Drawbacks:audio could have been better ( I use earphones and speaker so not an issue for me).definitely not a gaming laptop even if it advertises as such (xbox 3 month pass and I couldn't use it because video memory is lower than my previous lap)no backlit keyboard (it's not available in any IdeaPad slim 1)the metal body easily gets scratched and chipped (my advise is buy laptop bag or skin immediately, even a week is too late)Comment: first time ryzen user and gotta say it's good for everything outside gaming. Students and soft computer users can definitely go for this. If you're a gamer I would advise i5 and something with a graphic card. 16gb ram is better if you use a lot of softwares.;It's a good laptop for routine work not involving much graphics. Quality of body could have been better. Speaker audio is just about adequate. Worth the money paid;I received prodcut with defective speaker, sound quality is poor even at 100% volume. When I reached out to customer care they promised technician visit which did not happen, after called them again, I was promised return of the prodcut and refund to original payment. After multiple attempts, return was not picked up and refund was not provided. Amazon customer care told me, they started investigation why carrier did not pick-up and asked me wait for couple of days for resolution.  When I called after 3 days, I was told, everything is good on their side and they can not provide refund and won't be taking return as well.  This is daylight cheating and fradualent activity.  Customer care agent will provide template response and there is no esclation matrix for grievences.  I'm going to consumer court for on this matter.;Purchased this laptop to connect to office Citrix desktop and do work from home. Great speed and easy connectivity. I use my headset for audio and separate webcam for video calls so not tested the inbuilt webcam and speaker but should be pretty good. Worth the money and purchase.;Speed-5 starLooks-5 starCons- very less Usb ports and no LAN portOverall best choice.;The media could not be loaded.My personal review:1.Performance(Ram-16gb)Laptop runs smoothly even when you are multitasking and handles multiple tab opening easily.If you are not a heavy gamer ( you can play casual gaming easily  as well) but insteadwant a laptop for daily or office use, you will surely like this laptop.2. DisplayThe display is more than clear enough to watch movies or any content( obviously some would argue Oled display is better;but they come at a higher price as well).3.BatteryBattery lasts for around 3 hrs on a continuous usage( battery life could be better , but it's still ok at the price range)4.SoundSound quality is also good and clear .Sound loudness is more than enough , in my above video, the music video is being played at 56 volume which itself is loud enough for me.5.HeatingPersonally , not a heavy gamer , so heating has not been an issue for me.Final Review -If you never had a laptop and is thinking of getting this laptop, go for it , you won't get a better laptop at this price range.;In my point of this laptop is very very good because of its sound,screen,keyboard,and branding it has only one thing that is not good is it has not backlit if you think in photo it screen is not good but no my phone camera quality is not good if you think you will buy this laptop then you must and over all this laptop is so good and also have 65W charger",

The 12.7-inch 3K display offers stunning clarity and vibrant colors, making it ideal for streaming, reading, and creative tasks.With 8GB RAM and 256GB storage (expandable up to 1TB), it handles multitasking smoothly and provides ample space for apps, files, and media. The massive 10,200mAh battery ensures long hours of uninterrupted usage, whether you\u2019re working on the go or binge-watching your favorite shows.Overall, the Lenovo Tab P12 is an excellent investment for anyone seeking a premium tablet with top-tier performance and versatility. Highly recommended for students, professionals, and entertainment enthusiasts alike!;This is a good tab for daily use . Specially for students who use it for taking online classes or for conducting meeting it has a great camera that gives you quite vibrant pictures. This is the best tablet in this price segment. It has some cons like it does not work with local stylus pencil u have to buy the orginal lenovo pencil to use it.;Screen is super clear but 60hz, more than enough for movies and series, not ideal for gaming though. Audio is unexpectedly ultra good. Its probably better than most of the ipads, very close to mac m1 in terms of audio. battery life is okayish not very good not very bad. dimensity 7050 Processor is fine for moderate tasks, cant handle too much of heavy gaming. Overall a good product for its price, pen is smooth too, just not as good as samsung, the tip is plastic so you will feel like writing on a marble, apart that its precise. Theres some delay in response, like you would have dragged your pencil and you can see the line following up to your pencil, not a very major issue but need to be considered while making the purchase. If your aim is multimedia consumption, this is an ideal device for that, if aim is to game, go for xiaomi pad 6.;Easy to use, very good display, Audio and performance for non gaming activities.Works very well for videos, Movies, Photos over Wi-Fi.Build quality is solid and the size was something that you need to get used to.But it works well like a mini TV on the bed or at the dining table.;Values for money ! Wonderful speakers JBL mass .;Unfortunately a very troublesome purchase for me with both original and replacement device having battery issues and screen flickers, I'm not sure if i ended up with faulty devices both times or this model has such issues.If these issues didn't exist,  the tablet is excellent with regards to screen resolution,  weight,  size, audio is fantastic... Well... The return process also was painful with me being stuck with this for over a month.;Budget tab with big screen and it working nice and also it don't lag and have great battery life;Size, display quality, sound, performance everything is good except charging time which takes too long",

                "text": "Excellent product. I have been using this since October 2024 ,good battery,display and stylus is a huge help.;The media could not be loaded.A great experience using the TAB since I purchased. Only drawback is the touch response from the Pen provided. Battery life around 10K would have been great. Very sleek in design. Dolby Atmos sound gives great hearing experience. The 3mm audio port is placed at the corner is little awkward - should have been placed in the middle. Touch sensitivity was smooth. Performance is great. Very less heat generated even after prolonged usage. Scrolling speed and quality is great. Brightness is good. More shortcut options required in System control area. Would recommend for students and casual users at this reasonable price point. Would rate this product at 4/5 in overall.;This is the best table for animation in 20000\u20b9 and call of duty mobile was given 60 to 80 fps and battery life is good if you use full fledg it will come a complete day and sound quality is top notchand display quality is very good at this price point weight off it is light and touch functional is good feels like butterAnd multitasking is goodI am saying it after a month of use;The item I received had a defective USB port, Amazon couldn't help, return period got over, Lenovo does not respond to complaints. Humble suggestion to anyone - Not just this tablet, don't buy any electronic items from Amazon. If product runs smooth, great. In case there is a problem, amazon has no support system. They will say 'they directly can't change the item, you please raise a ticket with the manufacturer'. The manufacturer NEVER responds. Your return period window gets over. Then you are left with warranty period. I'm still struggling even to get a response from Lenovo for raising warranty claim. It has been months now. Don't buy such items from Amazon, instead buy from shops. You may pay some extra bucks, but you don't have to worry on returns / warranty claims in case of any issue.;Best budget tab for students. Palm rejection works perfectly.;The display, sound, look&feel at this budget is wonderful. I am happy for content watch, online meeting/class, reading pdfs, taking notes with the pen and some digital drawings too...all perfect.But as I am paying just 13k, I have to experince some wait-time, say when opening youtube or lag when the video appears. It needs bit patience. If some Lag is OK for you go for it, I don't see any other cons.;No doubt product is fantastic. User interface provides very friendly environment. Battery backup is also good. Sound quality clarity and volume everything is very good.The only draw back to have Lenovo product is to look for its service centre. They are very difficult to fetch. There very less or no service centre. You can't find them before Delhi.;Price good but feels some lag when notification come at down it lags like old TVs and takes long time to go. IF you searching for study purpose tablet go for it the pen was also good but showed me battery drain problem so I ordered the battery's but now there is no issue and I didn't inserted the battery. Sound quality is awesome it iterate usage is best never take much data. Charging is bit slow but tallerable.",

Adequate for basic tasks, but prepare for painfully slow browsing with multiple tabs on Chrome. God forbid if you open YouTube, the screen and colors are just dull and too washed out.;The laptop is very good and the functionality is great under such a economical price. The weight is also not so heavy. And the appearance is also great.;It's found better in short cost;Nice laptop for students and office work",

Size and weight is not too much. All together it is value for money.;The media could not be loaded.Using it for a month and a halfPros:16gb ram is a wise choice for a coder.Screen Quality is good (Don't know why there were a lot of negative reviews about it), Genuine Windows 11 and MS office (great for students and content creators),Lightweight, easy and fast.Drawbacks:audio could have been better ( I use earphones and speaker so not an issue for me).definitely not a gaming laptop even if it advertises as such (xbox 3 month pass and I couldn't use it because video memory is lower than my previous lap)no backlit keyboard (it's not available in any IdeaPad slim 1)the metal body easily gets scratched and chipped (my advise is buy laptop bag or skin immediately, even a week is too late)Comment: first time ryzen user and gotta say it's good for everything outside gaming. Students and soft computer users can definitely go for this. If you're a gamer I would advise i5 and something with a graphic card. 16gb ram is better if you use a lot of softwares.;It's a good laptop for routine work not involving much graphics. Quality of body could have been better. Speaker audio is just about adequate. Worth the money paid;I received prodcut with defective speaker, sound quality is poor even at 100% volume. When I reached out to customer care they promised technician visit which did not happen, after called them again, I was promised return of the prodcut and refund to original payment. After multiple attempts, return was not picked up and refund was not provided. Amazon customer care told me, they started investigation why carrier did not pick-up and asked me wait for couple of days for resolution.  When I called after 3 days, I was told, everything is good on their side and they can not provide refund and won't be taking return as well.  This is daylight cheating and fradualent activity.  Customer care agent will provide template response and there is no esclation matrix for grievences.  I'm going to consumer court for on this matter.;Purchased this laptop to connect to office Citrix desktop and do work from home. Great speed and easy connectivity. I use my headset for audio and separate webcam for video calls so not tested the inbuilt webcam and speaker but should be pretty good. Worth the money and purchase.;Speed-5 starLooks-5 starCons- very less Usb ports and no LAN portOverall best choice.;The media could not be loaded.My personal review:1.Performance(Ram-16gb)Laptop runs smoothly even when you are multitasking and handles multiple tab opening easily.If you are not a heavy gamer ( you can play casual gaming easily  as well) but insteadwant a laptop for daily or office use, you will surely like this laptop.2. DisplayThe display is more than clear enough to watch movies or any content( obviously some would argue Oled display is better;but they come at a higher price as well).3.BatteryBattery lasts for around 3 hrs on a continuous usage( battery life could be better , but it's still ok at the price range)4.SoundSound quality is also good and clear .Sound loudness is more than enough , in my above video, the music video is being played at 56 volume which itself is loud enough for me.5.HeatingPersonally , not a heavy gamer , so heating has not been an issue for me.Final Review -If you never had a laptop and is thinking of getting this laptop, go for it , you won't get a better laptop at this price range.;In my point of this laptop is very very good because of its sound,screen,keyboard,and branding it has only one thing that is not good is it has not backlit if you think in photo it screen is not good but no my phone camera quality is not good if you think you will buy this laptop then you must and over all this laptop is so good and also have 65W charger",

The AMD Ryzen processor is strong enough for regular use at home.As opposed to what many mention, the laptop does come with a backlit keyboard.There is a pre-installed Microsoft Office also ready to use. Just have to create an account if you don't have one and login.;Okay review after 3 months ? 2 months ? Idk I forgot anyways, the laptop is bigger than you'd expect, slim, light, above average performance!Pros :Back-lit keyboardAccessibility is numerous,Ryzen Processor > IntelDisplay : LargeColour contrast : Vibrant Colour, FHDCharging takes less time !Value for money ? Big yes !(Better than Ausus, HP, sorry not sorry but all my families use different laptop that's much pricier than this laptop but it outperforms ausus vivobook, hp)Cons :\u2022 Not for heavy gaming as it drains quiet fast when you play games on it ( on 100% it drained quiet fast when I played DOTA)\u2022 Bluetooth tend to stop working when you're using a wireless mouse/keyboard and Bluetooth earbuds both connected to the laptop (you have to disconnect either the ear buds or the mouse)Camera : TRASH (Sorry not sorry)Conclusion: Dont play heavy games, good for academic works ( if you're not a developer don't stress on it but learn python at the least lol )Should you buy it ?Yes, if it's well within your budget(It's better than vivobook :D);I bought this Lenovo Ideapad laptop 3 months ago and after use of less than 2 months battery is not taking charge. I called the Amazon customer care they told me to contact Lenovo customer care for support. And when I called Lenovo customer care they checked the laptop virtually by taker controls from Rescue Lens application and found that there is a issue with battery. And after 3-4 days one of their technician come to replace the battery and after replacing the battery issue still remains same. Then he troubleshooted and told us that its motherboard having issues so they have to replace motherboard. I asked them to replace full unit but they are denying. I again called the customer care of lenovo but they are denying to replace the unit. Also, when I bought this unit I found that the warranty on site shows expired. I think these lenovo company guys are so unprofessional and there is no management and quality check of the products.  At last I want to say please dont buy this product its unreliable.....Its waste of money.;Works excellentHas all featuresBattery works for good 5-6 hours on continuous working and watching video.Very smooth and sleek.Value for money.;;It doesn't have backlit keyboard but the device performance is efficient. Loads windows under 10 secs and no log observed so far. The sound quality is really good.;Every thing is good but you can not control blacklit keyboard intensity light. You can just turn it on or off. You can't change it to low, medium and high. And fingerprint senseor is not compatible for the hello window is showing.Good pointsPerformance is goodBattery is goodBad pointsYou can't ajust the light of keyboard. But you can it on/offFingerprint senor is not working error is showing.;Really good product from Lenovo. Awesome backlit. Very good display.",

Had one lenova laptop few years back too. Very sturdy laptops! I love this!;Display is poor.WIFI is going off all of sudden and every time we have to restart.. technical support is not able to solve the issue after 2 attempts...i would not recommend this product to anyone.;Overall, the product is quite good, but the battery drains rather quickly.

                "text": "Mine is the R7-5800H, 3050 varient. Delivered the day before yesterday. Got it for ~54,500 rupees in the Great Indian Sale with 4800 card discount and extra 10k off from exchange.The good:1_Absoule value for money at the price I bought it2_Legion's Keyboard..typing experience is stellar \ud83d\udc9a3_Great performance. Scored 13k+ on cinebench r23 multi-core test without using any cooling pad(ambient room temp about 23\u00b0c) I haven't played any games yet except for a VR title without any issues4_display quality is actually pretty good, (although not color accurate).5_ms office classic comes pre-installed6_not too bulky for a gaming laptop.The bad:1_ peak screen brightness is very low. Almost non-usable in ambient daylight at anything under 40% of it's peak brightness.2_Battery backup on this one is one of the worst I've seen in any laptops. So if intend to carry your laptop while travelling, better not forget the charging brick3_ the web cam quality is below average.The ugly:there're two hot air outlets/vents facing hinge of the laptop which releases warm air while gaming and heats up the entire lower part of the display panel\ud83e\udd2fI am worried if this amount of heat will eventually cause harm to the display or not!;;An awesome laptop with having good gaming processors must buy laptop.;1. Laptop screen gets damaged due to the keyboard marks. So you need to create a gap like I did- check the photo attached.2. The keyboard light stopped working. The premium support is scam as they will replace the parts with refurbished parts.3. Battery life is 1 hour to 1.5 hours at max.Don\u2019t waste your money on cheap products. Add some extra money and buy good stuff to save headache and heart break.;First of all, Thanks to Amazon and seller for getting this beauty delivered in 1 day.It's super fast get things done quickly, cpu is fast GPU is amazingUsing it majorily for wfh, but tried yday running far cry 6, my my it ran just smoothlyAfter a mnths of research I feel safe to say, this is an amazing laptop in this price range.If anyone would ask me, i would suggest simply go for this laptop looks are professional and also supports high end games, what else is required ?;Have been using this on and off for a couple of months. The performance and price to value seems to be fair.Running my daily tasks smoothly.Heats up while gaming, so I suggest get a raiser or a cooler to use with it.The battery backup is very disappointing. While watching or doing simple tasks, drains the battery quite quickly.Even keeping it idle for about 15mins would drain 20% battery.  That's on balanced mode.Will update this after a couple of months more.;Pros::This is One of the best laptops you could buy under 80000.: It has 16 gigs of RAM, which makes it really snappy, Every PC game that exists in this world could be played on this laptop.: The display is superb.:You get close to 480 gigs of SSD.: Transfer speed Between discs is really good, close to 1 gb/s. I made a transfer of 30 gigs and it took 33 seconds.Cons:: If you'll part the disk of C drive, close to 220 gigs will be reserved for C drive, which means maximum 260 gigs could be given to other partitions created.: Many people in their reviews mentioned that it was quite heavy, I have had it for quite some time now but I find it of average weight.: The charging port is given in the middle of the left side of laptop, not something I like personally.: There are only 2 USB A ports.Edit : The Heat Vents are on the hinge and really close to the  display so while playing games Like GTA 5, AC Valhalla, Red dead Redemption, it is going to get freaking hot.Tips :1) Install modern flyouts, it gives a really nice finish to sound and brightness menus.2) Install driver easy, there were close to 20 drivers pending for install.3) There are many complaining about the  battery, but I don't find any issue in plunging it in when using, also it gives a backup of around 3.5 hours when unplugged.Pro tip: Uninstall Microsoft Edge.",

                "text": "Excellent product. I have been using this since October 2024 ,good battery,display and stylus is a huge help.;The media could not be loaded.A great experience using the TAB since I purchased. Only drawback is the touch response from the Pen provided. Battery life around 10K would have been great. Very sleek in design. Dolby Atmos sound gives great hearing experience. The 3mm audio port is placed at the corner is little awkward - should have been placed in the middle. Touch sensitivity was smooth. Performance is great. Very less heat generated even after prolonged usage. Scrolling speed and quality is great. Brightness is good. More shortcut options required in System control area. Would recommend for students and casual users at this reasonable price point. Would rate this product at 4/5 in overall.;This is the best table for animation in 20000\u20b9 and call of duty mobile was given 60 to 80 fps and battery life is good if you use full fledg it will come a complete day and sound quality is top notchand display quality is very good at this price point weight off it is light and touch functional is good feels like butterAnd multitasking is goodI am saying it after a month of use;The item I received had a defective USB port, Amazon couldn't help, return period got over, Lenovo does not respond to complaints. Humble suggestion to anyone - Not just this tablet, don't buy any electronic items from Amazon. If product runs smooth, great. In case there is a problem, amazon has no support system. They will say 'they directly can't change the item, you please raise a ticket with the manufacturer'. The manufacturer NEVER responds. Your return period window gets over. Then you are left with warranty period. I'm still struggling even to get a response from Lenovo for raising warranty claim. It has been months now. Don't buy such items from Amazon, instead buy from shops. You may pay some extra bucks, but you don't have to worry on returns / warranty claims in case of any issue.;Best budget tab for students. Palm rejection works perfectly.;The display, sound, look&feel at this budget is wonderful. I am happy for content watch, online meeting/class, reading pdfs, taking notes with the pen and some digital drawings too...all perfect.But as I am paying just 13k, I have to experince some wait-time, say when opening youtube or lag when the video appears. It needs bit patience. If some Lag is OK for you go for it, I don't see any other cons.;No doubt product is fantastic. User interface provides very friendly environment. Battery backup is also good. Sound quality clarity and volume everything is very good.The only draw back to have Lenovo product is to look for its service centre. They are very difficult to fetch. There very less or no service centre. You can't find them before Delhi.;Price good but feels some lag when notification come at down it lags like old TVs and takes long time to go. IF you searching for study purpose tablet go for it the pen was also good but showed me battery drain problem so I ordered the battery's but now there is no issue and I didn't inserted the battery. Sound quality is awesome it iterate usage is best never take much data. Charging is bit slow but tallerable.",

This model is part of Lenovo's business series, usually produced in bulk for corporations (e.g., 1000-2000 pieces). Mine is unit number 829 of a 2000-piece batch, and the build quality feels premium, comparable to a \u20b938,000-\u20b940,000 product.I received a box-open product sealed with Lenovo-branded cello tape, but the laptop itself was unused and in perfect condition. Initially, the warranty showed as starting 4 months earlier, but I was able to update the purchase date online, and now the warranty reflects the correct start date.One issue I noticed is that the serial number on the bill does not match the serial number on the laptop. I am unsure if this will affect warranty claims or other services in the future. It would be helpful if the seller could clarify this discrepancy.Additionally, while the listing mentioned Windows 11 Professional, the laptop came with Windows 11 Home. However, MS Office 2021 (Student Edition) was included as promised.In terms of performance, the AMD Ryzen 3 7320U, 8GB RAM, and 512GB SSD ensure fast and smooth operation for daily tasks. The 14-inch FHD display is sharp and clear, and the laptop is lightweight (1.47 kg)\u2014making it portable and user-friendly. My wife loves using it for her office work and finds it easy to carry.\u2705 Pros:Premium build quality (business-grade)Fast and responsive performanceLightweight and sleek designWarranty correction option available\u274c Cons:Windows 11 Home instead of Windows 11 ProMismatched serial number on the billOverall, this laptop is worth every penny\u2014great looks, solid performance, and business-grade quality.

They know what they are selling and nothing will happen for 10 days, possibly a month. After that issues will start popping up. And the issues are unlike any I have ever seen. Sound stops suddenly, hopefully it is back once you restart. Key board currently has stopped working but before it stopped all letters got mapped to different keys. And the support link to raise a ticket is switched off for the company;Body, battery is changed to new but some internal fault is intact like charging port problem, trackpad insenstivity. but that's minor problem right.functionality is good display is okay overall quality is normal to law;;Excellent product condition. It looks brand new.Eventhough the packing, battery, charger are not lenovo, the performace and everything is excellent..  Need to wait and see further days to see the performance. For me it was 2019 mid year laptop. Local market\u3001you wont get this quality/spec at this price.But first impression is now the best impression.

The massive 10,200mAh battery ensures long hours of uninterrupted usage, whether you\u2019re working on the go or binge-watching your favorite shows.Overall, the Lenovo Tab P12 is an excellent investment for anyone seeking a premium tablet with top-tier performance and versatility. Highly recommended for students, professionals, and entertainment enthusiasts alike!;This is a good tab for daily use . Specially for students who use it for taking online classes or for conducting meeting it has a great camera that gives you quite vibrant pictures. This is the best tablet in this price segment. It has some cons like it does not work with local stylus pencil u have to buy the orginal lenovo pencil to use it.;Screen is super clear but 60hz, more than enough for movies and series, not ideal for gaming though. Audio is unexpectedly ultra good. Its probably better than most of the ipads, very close to mac m1 in terms of audio. battery life is okayish not very good not very bad. dimensity 7050 Processor is fine for moderate tasks, cant handle too much of heavy gaming. Overall a good product for its price, pen is smooth too, just not as good as samsung, the tip is plastic so you will feel like writing on a marble, apart that its precise. Theres some delay in response, like you would have dragged your pencil and you can see the line following up to your pencil, not a very major issue but need to be considered while making the purchase. If your aim is multimedia consumption, this is an ideal device for that, if aim is to game, go for xiaomi pad 6.;Easy to use, very good display, Audio and performance for non gaming activities.Works very well for videos, Movies, Photos over Wi-Fi.Build quality is solid and the size was something that you need to get used to.But it works well like a mini TV on the bed or at the dining table.;Values for money ! Wonderful speakers JBL mass .;Unfortunately a very troublesome purchase for me with both original and replacement device having battery issues and screen flickers, I'm not sure if i ended up with faulty devices both times or this model has such issues.If these issues didn't exist,  the tablet is excellent with regards to screen resolution,  weight,  size, audio is fantastic... Well... The return process also was painful with me being stuck with this for over a month.;Budget tab with big screen and it working nice and also it don't lag and have great battery life;Size, display quality, sound, performance everything is good except charging time which takes too long",

Size and weight is not too much. All together it is value for money.;The media could not be loaded.Using it for a month and a halfPros:16gb ram is a wise choice for a coder.Screen Quality is good (Don't know why there were a lot of negative reviews about it), Genuine Windows 11 and MS office (great for students and content creators),Lightweight, easy and fast.Drawbacks:audio could have been better ( I use earphones and speaker so not an issue for me).definitely not a gaming laptop even if it advertises as such (xbox 3 month pass and I couldn't use it because video memory is lower than my previous lap)no backlit keyboard (it's not available in any IdeaPad slim 1)the metal body easily gets scratched and chipped (my advise is buy laptop bag or skin immediately, even a week is too late)Comment: first time ryzen user and gotta say it's good for everything outside gaming. Students and soft computer users can definitely go for this. If you're a gamer I would advise i5 and something with a graphic card. 16gb ram is better if you use a lot of softwares.;It's a good laptop for routine work not involving much graphics. Quality of body could have been better. Speaker audio is just about adequate. Worth the money paid;I received prodcut with defective speaker, sound quality is poor even at 100% volume. When I reached out to customer care they promised technician visit which did not happen, after called them again, I was promised return of the prodcut and refund to original payment. After multiple attempts, return was not picked up and refund was not provided. Amazon customer care told me, they started investigation why carrier did not pick-up and asked me wait for couple of days for resolution.  When I called after 3 days, I was told, everything is good on their side and they can not provide refund and won't be taking return as well.  This is daylight cheating and fradualent activity.  Customer care agent will provide template response and there is no esclation matrix for grievences.  I'm going to consumer court for on this matter.;Purchased this laptop to connect to office Citrix desktop and do work from home. Great speed and easy connectivity. I use my headset for audio and separate webcam for video calls so not tested the inbuilt webcam and speaker but should be pretty good. Worth the money and purchase.;Speed-5 starLooks-5 starCons- very less Usb ports and no LAN portOverall best choice.;The media could not be loaded.My personal review:1.Performance(Ram-16gb)Laptop runs smoothly even when you are multitasking and handles multiple tab opening easily.If you are not a heavy gamer ( you can play casual gaming easily  as well) but insteadwant a laptop for daily or office use, you will surely like this laptop.2. DisplayThe display is more than clear enough to watch movies or any content( obviously some would argue Oled display is better;but they come at a higher price as well).3.BatteryBattery lasts for around 3 hrs on a continuous usage( battery life could be better , but it's still ok at the price range)4.SoundSound quality is also good and clear .Sound loudness is more than enough , in my above video, the music video is being played at 56 volume which itself is loud enough for me.5.HeatingPersonally , not a heavy gamer , so heating has not been an issue for me.Final Review -If you never had a laptop and is thinking of getting this laptop, go for it , you won't get a better laptop at this price range.;In my point of this laptop is very very good because of its sound,screen,keyboard,and branding it has only one thing that is not good is it has not backlit if you think in photo it screen is not good but no my phone camera quality is not good if you think you will buy this laptop then you must and over all this laptop is so good and also have 65W charger",

Awesome screen and looks premium. The keyboard is good. Got it for 48k in sale. The power back up is very poor which is only disadvantage I observed. The sound is very low. Many people complained MOBO. Will update after few weeksAfter a week of use, I loved everything about this laptop. Found no problem. Using this mostly for office work and entertainment. In batter save mode got 3.5hrs. in normal mode, hardly getting 1.5 to 2 hrs. In rapid charging mode, charged fully within 1 hr, which is quite good for me. Main drawbacks are sound, which is very low even in full volume, not good for people who watches movies and stuff in laptop. The camera quality is below par, totally disappointed with camera.;Battery drain is the only issue. Rest it is a fantastic laptop with premium build.;Here I bought 512GB SSD and when laptop is delivered it has 474GB SSD;I was quietly impressed with this LOQ series..Holding the box for first time doesn't feels like a gaming laptop \ud83d\udcbb . Having such a powerful processor and graphics card the weight of laptop is really nice . I played Gta 5 for around 1 2 hours in this case the laptop doesn't heat to much and also fan noise are not to loud. Lenevo really making this series looks like legion . Appreciate it lenevo.;Does everything you expect of it. Very sturdy and smooth.Battery life is slightly disappointing though, lasts 3-4 hours of using things like Word and PowerPoint as well, which is not ideal, but considering the hardware, somewhat expected. To be fair Lenovo has mentioned that on a packaging film beforehand itself.Does not have pre-installed activated MS Office, has to be bought separately (the Lenovo website version says that it has it).Otherwise pretty good.;The laptop is as good as I thought. No issues, no problem. I am an occasional gamer, so for me, it's good. And video editing is smooth.I don't know why people complaint about sound, the sound is satisfactory.The display is top notch and battery life is also good (approx 4 hrs on 100% charge). Makes no noise. Built quality is royal.Loved it.;It is a mid range laptop ,sound quality is superb, but its comes with low volume .Display:It comes with 300nits .Its excellent experience gives to user.Keyboard keys: very good key travel is superb,respond time also good.Track pad: very smooth response is good.Web cam :it is comes with 720p quality.Overall rating : I give 4out of 5 .",

It handles everyday tasks like note-taking, browsing, and streaming lectures smoothly. While it may not be a powerhouse for heavy gaming or complex design software, it\u2019s more than sufficient for a typical college student\u2019s needs.The laptop is lightweight and easy to carry, which is a big plus for a student constantly on the move between classes. The sleek design adds a professional touch, and it looks more expensive than it actually is.The battery life is commendable\u2014lasting long enough to get through a full day of classes without needing a charge, depending on usage.Overall, this laptop is a fantastic student-friendly option that balances performance and affordability. If you're looking for a dependable device for college, this is a great pick!;;Works as advertised! The included MS office was the clincher. Using for two weeks now!

The colors are little distracted and too whitish. The screen panel could have been better. However, considering the price I will say it works.6: It has Microsoft Office 217: Setting up is easy (ensure a good internet connection)8: Price - I got it at INR 32190.9: No fingerprint sensor10: weight is decent, not too heavy considering you choose 14 Inch version.;15' screenFaster performanceLenovo edge for quick support and software upgradesLight weight;This Lanovo laptop looks fine. But i have a major concern that I purchased this in last week of December 2024 and so my warranty of one year should be valid till December 2025, but it is showing that warranty started in July 2024.

While the product differed slightly from the description, I am overall satisfied with the purchase.Key Observations:1. Processor Upgrade: The listing mentioned an Intel Core i5-8400T, but I received an upgraded i5-8500T, which was a pleasant surprise.2. Model Variation: The variant I received was the Lenovo P330 Tiny, not the one listed. However, it\u2019s still a solid and compact model that suits my needs.3. SSD Quality: The SSD installed is a cheap Chinese brand, which could be better. I would have preferred a more reliable SSD for long-term use.4. Performance: The system performs well with 16GB DDR4 RAM and 512GB SSD. It handles both Windows 11 and Hackintosh Sequoia smoothly without any major issues.Overall Experience:Despite the discrepancies, the product is good for the price. It\u2019s a reliable and compact machine that works efficiently for both personal and professional use. The seller could improve by providing more accurate listings and better-quality components like the SSD.I\u2019d recommend this product to others looking for an affordable and powerful refurbished mini PC.;Purchased this  Lenovo Tiny refurbished desktop with an i5 processor, 16GB RAM, and a 480GB SSD, and I am thoroughly impressed! Despite being refurbished, it feels brand new and performs exceptionally well. The compact size is perfect for saving desk space, and the powerful configuration handles multitasking and office work effortlessly. It's a great value for the price, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and efficient desktop solution!;WINDOWS GETTING LOCKED ON ITS OWN AFTER 15 - 20 DAYS OF USAGE,  IT ASKS FOR PASSWORD, WHEN SELLER WAS CONTACTED FOR THIS ISSUE, SELLER TOLD THAT PC DATA WILL BE LOST AS IT NEEDS TO BE RESET! WE ASKED SELLER TO TAKE THIS PC BACK AS WE DONT WANT THIS PC OR ANY PC FROM YOU AS THIS IS RECURRING ISSUE, TO WHICH SELLER ASKED TO TAKE HELP FROM AMAZON! STRONGLY NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE SUCH PCS AS DATA GETS LOST AND NOT RELIABLE SOLUTION FROM SELLER!;The product is exactly as per specification and is performing well so far though it is only 3 days since I have started using it.;Product I got was very good. Found everything as described. Working good.;The media could not be loaded.I recently bought a refurbished Windows PC from Recycle Kart, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations! The performance is surprisingly good, with high speed and efficiency that rivals even brand-new systems.From the moment I booted it up, the system was smooth, responsive, and capable of handling multiple tasks seamlessly. It\u2019s clear that Recycle Kart has taken great care in refurbishing the PC, ensuring it works like new.What stood out even more was the value for money \u2013 getting such a high-performing device at a fraction of the cost of a new one is fantastic. It\u2019s an eco-friendly choice without compromising on quality.I highly recommend Recycle Kart to anyone considering a refurbished PC. I\u2019m genuinely happy with my purchase!;Good product and best supportn;I am using this Mini PC since 1week, and it\u2019s performing as expected.product packaging was good and delivered on time.",

                "text": "The product has fallen multiple times but it's still good...value for money;Wonderfull go for it;Nice product;I\u2019ve been using mouse for almost a year now, and it has exceeded my expectations. There\u2019s absolutely no lag during use, even though I use it every day for work and general browsing. The battery life is impressive\u2014I've only had to replace the batteries once, which is a huge plus.The mouse itself is compact and fits comfortably in my hand, making it very easy to use for long periods without discomfort. Overall, it\u2019s a dependable, well-designed product that I\u2019d definitely recommend for everyday use;Everything is good and works like a charmm, feels heavy, useiing it almost 3 years. What i dislike about it is auto slleep while idle can be added within this price range.;I recently purchased the Lenovo 300 Wireless Compact Mouse, and I must say it has exceeded my expectations in several aspects. This compact and sleek mouse offers a great balance of functionality and portability, earning it a solid four-star rating.One of the standout features of this mouse is its compact design. It fits comfortably in my hand, and the low-profile design makes it easy to carry in my laptop bag without taking up much space. The compact form factor doesn't compromise functionality, as the buttons are well-placed and responsive.The wireless connectivity is reliable, and the setup was a breeze. The mouse connects seamlessly to my laptop without any noticeable lag, providing a hassle-free user experience. The wireless range is sufficient for my needs, and the included USB receiver can be conveniently stored in the mouse itself, reducing the risk of misplacement.The overall build quality of the Lenovo 300 is commendable. Despite its compact size, the mouse feels sturdy and durable. The click buttons have a satisfying tactile response, and the scroll wheel operates smoothly. The textured surface of the mouse provides a good grip, enhancing control during use.The battery life is impressive. With regular usage, I found that the mouse lasts for an extended period before needing a battery replacement. The automatic sleep mode further conserves battery life, and it quickly wakes up with a click when needed.While the Lenovo 300 is suitable for everyday use, it might not be the ideal choice for users with larger hands who prefer a fuller-sized mouse. Additionally, the lack of customizable buttons may be a drawback for those who rely on additional functionalities for specific tasks.;It's fake chinese product useless not working after 3 months and for warranty they do not have anything only on paper;Build quality- 5/5 (Shell is smooth, grippy, solid)Click quality- 5/5 (Tactile, Not too loud, rebound is good enough, perfect for office work)Click latency- 2/5 (Sometimes the first click immediately after an operation is delayed, but can get used to it)Scroll wheel- 3/5 (tactile stepped scrolls, scroll wheel itself is too smooth, cannot attest to the longevity of the scroll wheel)Battery Life - 4/5 (seems good so far, mostly irrelevant because it's a replaceable battery instead of a rechargeable battery; rechargeable batteries are worse for the environment and is a nuisance to charge compared to a standard AA battery)Tracking - Untested, It's good enough for office, don't know about tracking in games. Lift off Distance is fairly high (2-3cms).Mouse feet- Very smooth, not scratchy at all when paired with a mousepad.BIGGEST CON is that it does not auto turn off or sleep when inactive. So it's draining battery the whole time you leave it on. The issue with that is, using the ON/OFF toggle (located under the mouse) everyday would cause it to break. It will be the first breaking point of the mouse. The second might be the scroll wheel.Unfortunately I had no other option than a wireless mouse, but in this price bracket, if circumstances allow me, I would go for a wired office mouse.Otherwise, this is probably the best Wireless Mouse for in this range.;Mouse preciso, bonito e de qualidade comprovada, recomendo muito pra quem tem duvidas;Livr\u00e9 comme pr\u00e9vu, fonctionne comme pr\u00e9vu;I kept this mouse in my bag to go to uni and it was so handy to have something low cost, portable yet still a full mouse. Fantastic!;Funciona bien;",

The return process was arduous for me.I feel buying refurbished item is a gamble and I regretted it.;Positives: If we compare speed of this laptop with the latest i3 and i5 processors, it is really fast given the price it is available. I have run couple of games and had no issues whatsoever. Browsing is really fast and multimedia has no issues at all. It plays and edits 4k videos without any flow. Very light weight and handy.Minor issues: Battery is a bit on lower performance. It is a refurbished product and some panels, parts, switches may have been changed and may not feel premium as new.Clarification on Features: No touchscreen, No fingerprint sensor, No backlight. Windows 11, MS Office etc pre-installed.;Superb working as new one;Product is okay but battery problem andd i return but multiple times it's failed and after that Amazon team raise investigation and after investigation off they told this product don't return don't buy itt;Good product in all aspects.;Has no scratch,no touch screen, just external battery, does the work,some keypads were not working but fixable...value for money,system is good ,customer service was good;Condition is good but screen quality is bad.

Build quality\ud83d\udca5.) Display worth the money.) Battery life - I got 7.5 hrs with normal usage ( offline movies + YouTube + Browsing + Pdf reading) with Wifi and Bluetooth turned on all the time...I kept brightness at 30% ( since It is sufficient for me in indoors ) and in dark mode...Another time I got only 5.5 hrs of battery life...so not sure of the exact battery span..) Flip to start is very useful.) Booting time is only 10-15 secs max.) Performance is good for this budget.) Light weight and very convenient to use especially for studyingCons :- \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e.) Heating issue while charging\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8.) Sometimes it heats up even with normal usage.) Speaker is good but sound is low.) Missing fingerprint sensor/Facial recognition in this rangeTips :-.) Don't charge immediately after using for more hours...let the heat to cool down and then charge.) After charging let the heat to cool down..then start to use ( will Increase battery span )Product got delivered b4 the due date...and packaging was good \ud83d\udc4dConclusion : Simply go for it if you are a student and doesn't play that much of games\ud83d\udca5;Lightweight, good quality, high performance, good battery life and fast charging. I brought before 4 months and used for high performance programming. Over all its worth buying and truly made for developers.;I bought this laptop few days back. There was an issue with the screen so I had to return/replace it. The amazon guys has been lying from start. They said they were going to initiate a lenovo technician visit. I waited for 2 days, no one came so I called lenovo directly. They said they had no notification regarding any booking of technician visit.Once I booked the technician visit in lenovo's side a visit was arranged. In the meantime amazon kept telling me that their hands are tied as long as the product is not sealed by lenovo. Once lenoco technician checks the project and gives no objection for return we will return/replace it immediately. Now it has been almost 2 weeks, everyday a return is created and gets cancelled saying the product was not ready when actually no one visited.My biggest mistake was to buy it from amazon. The laptop is actually good. But directly from lenovo or may ve croma.;It's very slim , The build is plastic but it's very tough , the display is FHD and it's a good display, The processer is actually a beast but you need to use it on charging to utilise it's full capacity , battery backup despite of having a H series processor and 48W Battery it performs very well and give you a 5hr screen on time the sound isn't too loud but if you keep it on your lap or so then you won't face any issue , And the main keypoint of this laptop is it's i7 13gen processor which is very very powerful but remember it has a intel UHD graphics so you are not going to play any graphics involving games it won't be a smooth experience overall a good product for real;Great product. Got it for 43k so a sweet purchase.Few cons:No Type-C Charging \u2013 This is the biggest letdown.No Fingerprint Sensor \u2013 At this price point (60k), it's a noticeable omission.Can't Be Opened with One Hand \u2013 Not a dealbreaker, but it would have been a nice touch.Lid Feels a Bit Fragile \u2013 Possibly due to being too tight, making the lid feel delicate when opening.;Within 15 hours I got product after ordered, product build quality is very poor. You will not feel satisfaction after 56K spend. Other body quality is very poor and all core are sharp.Performance wise good because very hi fi processor and RAM.I will not recommend if you searching good and attractive body quality and  robust Laptop.;Have been using this for more than a month now.Everything about this laptop is perfect, The processor combines high power efficiency along with great performance, giving this laptop a good battery backup.16 GB ram is adequate and it can handle multitasking very well. The laptop starts up very quickly thanks to the SSD used.Design and finishing is perfect. Would recommend this to others.",

                "text": "I recently purchased the **Lenovo ThinkCentre M710q Desktop Mini PC (Refurbished)** and I am absolutely blown away! \ud83d\udcbb\u2728 This little powerhouse has exceeded all my expectations, and I can\u2019t wait to share my experience with you.Performance That Packs a Punch! \ud83d\udcaaThe Intel Core i3 6th Gen processor** (3.2 GHz) combined with 8 GB DDR4 RAM and a 256 GB SSD makes this mini PC a beast for everyday tasks. Whether I\u2019m multitasking, streaming, or working on documents, it handles everything with ease. The Intel HD Graphics 530 ensures smooth visuals, and the Windows 11 OS (pre-installed) is a cherry on top! \ud83c\udf52Compact & Stylish Design \ud83d\udda4The sleek, black design is so compact that it fits perfectly on my desk without taking up much space. It\u2019s lightweight (just 1.5 kg) and portable, making it ideal for small workspaces or even carrying around if needed. The multiple ports (USB, DisplayPort, VGA, LAN, Audio in/out) are a lifesaver for all my connectivity needs.Refurbished? Feels Brand New! \ud83c\udf81I was a bit skeptical about buying a refurbished product, but this one looks and works like it\u2019s straight out of the box! The 6-month seller warranty gave me peace of mind, and the secure packaging ensured it arrived in pristine condition. Kudos to **Amazon Renewed** for maintaining such high standards! \ud83d\udc4fValue for Money? Absolutely! \ud83d\udcb0At just \u20b96,029, this is an absolute steal! The original price was \u20b989,999, and I saved a whopping 93%! \ud83e\udd11 Plus, the No Cost EMI option made it even more affordable. For the performance and features it offers, this is hands down the best deal I\u2019ve come across.Perfect for Everyday Use \ud83c\udfe0\ud83d\udcbcWhether you\u2019re a student, professional, or just need a reliable PC for everyday tasks, this mini PC is perfect. It\u2019s great for **business use**, **online classes**, **content streaming**, and even light gaming. The MS Office trial version is a nice bonus for productivity.Minor Drawbacks \u26a0\ufe0fThe only downside is the lack of an HDMI port, but a simple DisplayPort to HDMI adapter solved that issue. Also, the Wi-Fi adapter is a bit outdated, so I had to use an external one for faster connectivity. But these are minor hiccups considering the overall value.Final Verdict \ud83c\udfc6If you\u2019re looking for a budget-friendly, high-performance mini PC, the Lenovo ThinkCentre M710q is the way to go! It\u2019s reliable, efficient, and perfect for both personal and professional use. I\u2019m thrilled with my purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone!Rating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 (5/5)Pros:\u2705 Excellent performance\u2705 Compact & stylish design\u2705 Great value for money\u2705 Multiple connectivity options\u2705 Refurbished quality feels brand newCons:\u274c No HDMI port (requires adapter)\u274c Outdated Wi-Fi adapterThank you, **Amazon** and **NewJaisa**, for this amazing product! \ud83d\ude4c I\u2019m a happy customer and will definitely be recommending this to my friends and family. \ud83c\udf89;The PC came well-packaged, with everything neatly secured in a foam box. However, the VGA connector wire wasn't included, which is understandable for a refurbished unit. It runs Windows 11 smoothly so far, though I haven't used it extensively yet\u2014I'll update this review after more usage. Deducting one star as the casing has a few scratches. While that's expected with a refurbished product, it's worth noting. Overall, great value for money and definitely worth considering! Pretty compact too. Even though the PC uses VGA connector, the display quality is pretty good!;Great Value for a Refurbished CPU!I recently purchased This refurbished CPU, and I couldn't be happier with my experience. The product arrived well-packaged, looking almost brand new, with barely visible signs of wear and tear. Setting it up was a breeze, and it\u2019s been running flawlessly ever since.Performance-wise, it exceeded my expectations. It handles multitasking and heavy workloads like a champ, and I've noticed no difference compared to a brand-new processor. Plus, the price was unbeatable definitely a great way to save money without sacrificing quality.If you're hesitant about buying refurbished, don't be. This purchase proves that refurbished products can deliver excellent performance and value. Highly recommended!;Wifi not working unable to connect,I made a mistake to bought this product at refurbished section, amazon failed the promises of discription, no dent and scratches mentioned, but I received very old pc like painting were pale in colour, totally scrap model, don't buy this if you are in tamilnadu,You see lots of positive comments, I think they are forced to do it, or in North India warehouse could deliver good product, but south Indian warehouse might deliver scrap model and I felt cheated.Today onwards, if I order a product from Amazon beat me with your slippers.;Very good working as expected;It's working good.this is a very good CPU in low budget referbished section;Product is awesomeBut I can't find dp to vga adapter;Product looks and works smoothly as of now",

Despite the hardware being in good condition, the device froze during an update and has been unusable since (photo attached).*Unsuccessful Support Experience:*I've contacted both Amazon and Lenovo support multiple times, but unfortunately, no meaningful assistance has been provided. The replacement period expired on [Date], and now Amazon seems to have washed their hands off the issue.*Seeking Action:*I request Amazon to take immediate action and provide a suitable resolution, considering the device's warranty period had barely lapsed. I expect:1. Replacement or refund2. Expedited support to resolve the issue*Amazon, please take note:* Your customers deserve better. I hope you'll take necessary steps to address this issue and prevent similar experiences for others.*Update:* I'll update this review based on Amazon's response and resolutionUpdate: November 7thI'm still without a functioning machine, it's almost a month since the purchase . The seller only dispatched the hard drive today, after holding onto it for 7 days, and only doing so after I followed up repeatedly to prompt action. According to the tracking information, I won't receive it until November 14th.The lack of urgency and communication from the seller is quite frustrating.*Other customers, beware:* Check your device's warranty and support options before purchasing.Waiting for a prompt response and resolution, Amazon!;I got this a month ago, started using it as my home server with a Linux server on it, I've had no issues, the insides were clean, there is an empty M.2 NVMe slot to add an SSD down the line but I feel the 512GB SSD is adequate, not a reputed company so keep backups but it's fine for most applications given the rest of the systemThe wifi dongle provided however is absolute crap and borderline manufactured e-waste, buy a separate, better 5Ghz wifi dongle if you plan on using it with wifi but there is a 1 Gigabit Ethernet port of you don't plan toWill update if it stops working for any reason whatsoever;I recently received my mini PC, and so far, it has exceeded my expectations. The system is working flawlessly, effortlessly handling my day-to-day tasks. The Intel i5 8th Gen processor, though a bit seasoned, still proves to be highly relevant and powerful for contemporary use. I dont exactly know what is the brand of ram or ssd used, but they seem to be working fine.One minor hiccup worth mentioning is that if you plan to reinstall the operating system, you'll need to get Office 2021 and Windows 11 reactivated by RecycleKart. It's a slight inconvenience, but not a deal-breaker given the overall performance and quality of the system.Speaking of RecycleKart, their customer care is top-notch. They have been extremely responsive and helpful, ensuring a smooth experience from purchase to setup.Overall, I am very satisfied with this mini PC. It's a reliable, efficient device that caters well to my daily computing needs.;Its been 3 weeks and this item has been working well so far, it has ms office installed but does not come with microsoft office license otherwise there are no issues with windows 11. I perform lightweight tasks like browsing and watching videos, this pc can do all that without any fuss. I also did not notice any heating or fan running faster, no noise. HDMI port works fine, i connected it with my acer display.;I bought this tiny PC. Overall performance is good. Except for the master SSD, everything seems good. SSD is slow after using it for a week. system hangs because of the SSD. If you have a budget for an NVME SSD, add it to the PC. Then it will be good.;The PC had Internet Issues in Wifi Card.. As it was in the Replacement Time we opted for Replacement.. but as after various long discussions... Which lasted for 4 days after a technician visit was arranged and his report was filied by him just at the moment in from but it took 2 days for report to reach service centre and after that they told there is no replacement available so refund will be generated once the pickup is done... Now they tell that after the pickup on 16th Dec the pickup will be recieved by amazon on 23rd Dec and Refund will be initiated after 5Jan????? WTH?? I needed PC today and therefore i ordered it on amazon... If u cant provide me a proper working pc then atleast intiate my refund instantly so that i can get a pc here?? Money is stuck now and i have to wait... As the say ... And customer service is very very poor u dont even have a customer care number ??? This big platform and no Service care number??? Very dissatisfied... I dont recommend anyone to buy refurbished things on amazon ... Waste of Time and Energy....;Experience lightning-fast performance with this compact computing solution.  The exceptionally quick boot speed minimizes downtime and maximizes productivity.  A conveniently located HDMI port allows for seamless connection to external displays.

Initially, I was a bit skeptical about buying a refurbished product, but this laptop has completely exceeded my expectations.Firstly, the condition of the laptop is impeccable. It looks and feels brand new, with no visible signs of wear or tear. The packaging was also secure and ensured that the laptop arrived in perfect condition.Performance-wise, this Lenovo laptop is a powerhouse. It runs smoothly and efficiently, handling multiple tasks with ease. Whether I'm browsing the web, streaming videos, or working on documents, it handles everything effortlessly. The processor is fast, and the RAM ensures seamless multitasking.The display is vibrant and crisp, providing an excellent viewing experience for both work and entertainment purposes. The keyboard is comfortable to type on, and the trackpad is responsive and precise.Moreover, I appreciate the value for money that this refurbished Lenovo laptop offers. It provides high-end performance at a fraction of the cost of a new device, making it an excellent investment for anyone in need of a reliable laptop without breaking the bank.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. This refurbished Lenovo laptop from Amazon has proven to be a fantastic investment, offering top-notch performance, sleek design, and great value for money. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a quality laptop at an affordable price.;After seeing good reviews I bought this laptop, it workd normally for 1 month, then over heating problem was there, and two batteries are inside laptop but they disconnected 2 nd battery from laptop, dont know why they disconnected second battery. After 3 month month my laptop dead, its not even switching on, gave it to service center, they said circuit failure and ic failure, its repair cost is very high. So please buy new Laptop in Emi, dont fall for rate. Save;I bought this ThinkPad for 15000rs I was a bit skepticle since it is refurbished but bought it anyway when I saw the no. of purchases on this.i was unsure of what model it was at the time of purchasing since it is not mentioned .i recieved a t470 with the mentioned processor and ram with a satisfactory 1080p screen and a good 3-4 hours external battery backup,internal battery is not given but you can get one separately. No scratches to be seen as such ,keyboard and trackpad,trackpoint were perfectly good ,handles win 11 like a beast ,tho I prefer win 10 ,it will get the work done ,but don't buy for editing and gaming ofcourse(you can enjoy older games tho, search on YouTube \"games for hd520\",i tried valorant ,it gives anywhere from 50 to 95 fps at 1600x900res) ,classic ThinkPad design is a thing of beauty, newer laptops available at starting range of 30000rs can't even compare to this,though it heats up just a tad bit but that's okay for a laptop,though I would mention I have seen gap in body joints(i will attach a pic) but I wouldn't mind that.since it is amazon fulfilled and has 6 months warranty , i recommend it ,will give you much better experience then any new entry level laptop;Subject: Request for Refund/Replacement for Defective Refurbished LaptopDear Amazon Customer Service,I am writing to bring to your attention an issue with a Lenovo refurbished laptop I recently purchased from Amazon. Unfortunately, the product I received is defective and does not meet the expected quality standards.The laptop has the following issues:[\"The battery does not charge.\"]Given this situation, I kindly request one of the following resolutions:1.

A replacement with a functional unit.Additionally, I suggest Amazon refrain from selling refurbished laptops that fail to meet quality checks to avoid inconveniences for future customers.Please respond at your earliest convenience with the next steps to resolve this issue.;My old Lenovo laptop was out of date with Windows7 and I needed a better configuration which suits the current need of the day . I bought the laptop after much apprehension as I had never taken a refurbished product .When I received the product first , I checked the configuration and it was carrying the same . However on closer  scrutiny I found out that some of the keys were not working and one of the locks of the battery was broken . I raised a request for replacement and the same was addressed by Amazon as well as the seller promptly .However , the next laptop which was delivered , had a teething battery issue and every time I contacted the tech team of the seller , they responded properly , checked the system online and sent a replacement . When I received the third battery it seemed okay but simultaneously the screen went off and started showing multi colours . Tech team again checked the system and got it picked up by a couriers and delivered another one in around 10 days .The current system is being used for the past 8-9 days and it is currently running fine .The seller has an excellent Tech Support team , special mention of their engineer Ali who patiently listens to the problem . However their Quality Check team is extremely careless and not doing their job properly . This is why I am deducting one mark from the overall rating  .The configuration is good for this price and certainly  serves to students who are on a shoestring budget .",

Always has some problem or the other. There is no value for money. It is not worth buying from thus seller.;Everything was great according to the price. Each specification matches the original product that we received. Genuine product works fine till now.;The product received is amazing in nearly used condition. Everything including the RAM is as described in the product details. Customer service is very responsive.  Go for it guys, it's totally value for money.;I recently purchased a PC from Amazon dealer NewJaisa, and unfortunately, my experience has been far from satisfactory.Firstly, the hardware issues are a major concern. I've been facing persistent LAN connectivity problems and difficulties with the WiFi connection. These issues significantly impact the usability of the product.Despite reporting the problems and receiving a replacement from the supplier, the issues persist. The lack of effective after-sales service is disappointing, leaving me without a resolution.Additionally, the operating system's performance is subpar, even after multiple resets. This has resulted in a frustratingly slow user experience.In summary, my overall experience with NewJaisa's PC has been marred by hardware issues, lack of effective support, and performance issues even after replacement. I would advise potential buyers to exercise caution when considering products from this dealer.;I recently purchased the refurbished Lenovo desktop from Amazon and I'm thoroughly impressed! The machine was packaged well and arrived in pristine condition.The desktop performs smoothly, and I've experienced no issues so far. The refurbisher did a great job of ensuring everything was in working order. The included 6 months warranty gives me peace of mind.The price was significantly lower than a new model with similar specs, making this a fantastic value. I highly recommend Amazon for refurbished desktops.If you're looking for a reliable desktop without breaking the bank, consider this refurbished option.;CHEATING advertisement as MS Office 19 Not working After 6Months it's Requireb Activation Key .Being a Old Prime Customer feels frustrated and cheated on Amazon name brand.Windows 11 pro wchich has installed li my products not working properly, frequently at the interval of 15 minuts shown error and shut down and we have to switched off and restarting, I think it is  not a original copy of  windows 11 pro installed in my unit by supplier. This is for your kind information and necessary action please.DCSingh Lucknow;Perfectly working condition, negligible marks, 99% new condition. Great Product at this price. Just one think inter sticker outside the PC says Core i5, whereas inside I checked it's true i7 with activated Windows 10 Pro. Haven't tried MS Office yet it's also installed.",

The AMD Ryzen processor is strong enough for regular use at home.As opposed to what many mention, the laptop does come with a backlit keyboard.There is a pre-installed Microsoft Office also ready to use. Just have to create an account if you don't have one and login.;Okay review after 3 months ? 2 months ? Idk I forgot anyways, the laptop is bigger than you'd expect, slim, light, above average performance!Pros :Back-lit keyboardAccessibility is numerous,Ryzen Processor > IntelDisplay : LargeColour contrast : Vibrant Colour, FHDCharging takes less time !Value for money ? Big yes !(Better than Ausus, HP, sorry not sorry but all my families use different laptop that's much pricier than this laptop but it outperforms ausus vivobook, hp)Cons :\u2022 Not for heavy gaming as it drains quiet fast when you play games on it ( on 100% it drained quiet fast when I played DOTA)\u2022 Bluetooth tend to stop working when you're using a wireless mouse/keyboard and Bluetooth earbuds both connected to the laptop (you have to disconnect either the ear buds or the mouse)Camera : TRASH (Sorry not sorry)Conclusion: Dont play heavy games, good for academic works ( if you're not a developer don't stress on it but learn python at the least lol )Should you buy it ?Yes, if it's well within your budget(It's better than vivobook :D);I bought this Lenovo Ideapad laptop 3 months ago and after use of less than 2 months battery is not taking charge. I called the Amazon customer care they told me to contact Lenovo customer care for support. And when I called Lenovo customer care they checked the laptop virtually by taker controls from Rescue Lens application and found that there is a issue with battery. And after 3-4 days one of their technician come to replace the battery and after replacing the battery issue still remains same. Then he troubleshooted and told us that its motherboard having issues so they have to replace motherboard. I asked them to replace full unit but they are denying. I again called the customer care of lenovo but they are denying to replace the unit. Also, when I bought this unit I found that the warranty on site shows expired. I think these lenovo company guys are so unprofessional and there is no management and quality check of the products.  At last I want to say please dont buy this product its unreliable.....Its waste of money.;Works excellentHas all featuresBattery works for good 5-6 hours on continuous working and watching video.Very smooth and sleek.Value for money.;;It doesn't have backlit keyboard but the device performance is efficient. Loads windows under 10 secs and no log observed so far. The sound quality is really good.;Every thing is good but you can not control blacklit keyboard intensity light. You can just turn it on or off. You can't change it to low, medium and high. And fingerprint senseor is not compatible for the hello window is showing.Good pointsPerformance is goodBattery is goodBad pointsYou can't ajust the light of keyboard. But you can it on/offFingerprint senor is not working error is showing.;Really good product from Lenovo. Awesome backlit. Very good display.",

Size and weight is not too much. All together it is value for money.;The media could not be loaded.Using it for a month and a halfPros:16gb ram is a wise choice for a coder.Screen Quality is good (Don't know why there were a lot of negative reviews about it), Genuine Windows 11 and MS office (great for students and content creators),Lightweight, easy and fast.Drawbacks:audio could have been better ( I use earphones and speaker so not an issue for me).definitely not a gaming laptop even if it advertises as such (xbox 3 month pass and I couldn't use it because video memory is lower than my previous lap)no backlit keyboard (it's not available in any IdeaPad slim 1)the metal body easily gets scratched and chipped (my advise is buy laptop bag or skin immediately, even a week is too late)Comment: first time ryzen user and gotta say it's good for everything outside gaming. Students and soft computer users can definitely go for this. If you're a gamer I would advise i5 and something with a graphic card. 16gb ram is better if you use a lot of softwares.;It's a good laptop for routine work not involving much graphics. Quality of body could have been better. Speaker audio is just about adequate. Worth the money paid;I received prodcut with defective speaker, sound quality is poor even at 100% volume. When I reached out to customer care they promised technician visit which did not happen, after called them again, I was promised return of the prodcut and refund to original payment. After multiple attempts, return was not picked up and refund was not provided. Amazon customer care told me, they started investigation why carrier did not pick-up and asked me wait for couple of days for resolution.  When I called after 3 days, I was told, everything is good on their side and they can not provide refund and won't be taking return as well.  This is daylight cheating and fradualent activity.  Customer care agent will provide template response and there is no esclation matrix for grievences.  I'm going to consumer court for on this matter.;Purchased this laptop to connect to office Citrix desktop and do work from home. Great speed and easy connectivity. I use my headset for audio and separate webcam for video calls so not tested the inbuilt webcam and speaker but should be pretty good. Worth the money and purchase.;Speed-5 starLooks-5 starCons- very less Usb ports and no LAN portOverall best choice.;The media could not be loaded.My personal review:1.Performance(Ram-16gb)Laptop runs smoothly even when you are multitasking and handles multiple tab opening easily.If you are not a heavy gamer ( you can play casual gaming easily  as well) but insteadwant a laptop for daily or office use, you will surely like this laptop.2. DisplayThe display is more than clear enough to watch movies or any content( obviously some would argue Oled display is better;but they come at a higher price as well).3.BatteryBattery lasts for around 3 hrs on a continuous usage( battery life could be better , but it's still ok at the price range)4.SoundSound quality is also good and clear .Sound loudness is more than enough , in my above video, the music video is being played at 56 volume which itself is loud enough for me.5.HeatingPersonally , not a heavy gamer , so heating has not been an issue for me.Final Review -If you never had a laptop and is thinking of getting this laptop, go for it , you won't get a better laptop at this price range.;In my point of this laptop is very very good because of its sound,screen,keyboard,and branding it has only one thing that is not good is it has not backlit if you think in photo it screen is not good but no my phone camera quality is not good if you think you will buy this laptop then you must and over all this laptop is so good and also have 65W charger",

The AMD Ryzen processor is strong enough for regular use at home.As opposed to what many mention, the laptop does come with a backlit keyboard.There is a pre-installed Microsoft Office also ready to use. Just have to create an account if you don't have one and login.;Okay review after 3 months ? 2 months ? Idk I forgot anyways, the laptop is bigger than you'd expect, slim, light, above average performance!Pros :Back-lit keyboardAccessibility is numerous,Ryzen Processor > IntelDisplay : LargeColour contrast : Vibrant Colour, FHDCharging takes less time !Value for money ? Big yes !(Better than Ausus, HP, sorry not sorry but all my families use different laptop that's much pricier than this laptop but it outperforms ausus vivobook, hp)Cons :\u2022 Not for heavy gaming as it drains quiet fast when you play games on it ( on 100% it drained quiet fast when I played DOTA)\u2022 Bluetooth tend to stop working when you're using a wireless mouse/keyboard and Bluetooth earbuds both connected to the laptop (you have to disconnect either the ear buds or the mouse)Camera : TRASH (Sorry not sorry)Conclusion: Dont play heavy games, good for academic works ( if you're not a developer don't stress on it but learn python at the least lol )Should you buy it ?Yes, if it's well within your budget(It's better than vivobook :D);I bought this Lenovo Ideapad laptop 3 months ago and after use of less than 2 months battery is not taking charge. I called the Amazon customer care they told me to contact Lenovo customer care for support. And when I called Lenovo customer care they checked the laptop virtually by taker controls from Rescue Lens application and found that there is a issue with battery. And after 3-4 days one of their technician come to replace the battery and after replacing the battery issue still remains same. Then he troubleshooted and told us that its motherboard having issues so they have to replace motherboard. I asked them to replace full unit but they are denying. I again called the customer care of lenovo but they are denying to replace the unit. Also, when I bought this unit I found that the warranty on site shows expired. I think these lenovo company guys are so unprofessional and there is no management and quality check of the products.  At last I want to say please dont buy this product its unreliable.....Its waste of money.;Works excellentHas all featuresBattery works for good 5-6 hours on continuous working and watching video.Very smooth and sleek.Value for money.;;It doesn't have backlit keyboard but the device performance is efficient. Loads windows under 10 secs and no log observed so far. The sound quality is really good.;Every thing is good but you can not control blacklit keyboard intensity light. You can just turn it on or off. You can't change it to low, medium and high. And fingerprint senseor is not compatible for the hello window is showing.Good pointsPerformance is goodBattery is goodBad pointsYou can't ajust the light of keyboard. But you can it on/offFingerprint senor is not working error is showing.;Really good product from Lenovo. Awesome backlit. Very good display.",

                "text": "Thanks to amazon for giving massive discount on my sbi card during republic day sale which made it possible for me to get this beast. It performs as you think it would.Everything runs buttery smooth but there is battery drop issue i think 230w adapter will fix that aside from that there is not problem and rgb backlight keyboard would have been cool.;So the best thing about this laptop is that the build quality is sturdy. Do note that this processor has no iGPU so your battery life is limited to 4 hours and does not go higher than that when not plugged in. That being said a friend of mine got the G14 zyphrus and we were gaming at max settings and this laptop did not hit 60 degrees whereas the G14 was touching 85 degrees hence the cooling system is amazing. Another thing I have realised is that I don\u2019t use the laptop when it isn\u2019t plugged in and I do not require 15 -20 hrs of battery life. Also all tasks and jobs run very smoothly on this and I feel its worth the trade off for price and hardware;Got it at 71k, faced a screen flickering issue after 2 days but other than that it worths every single penny in terms of display and gaming. It has better display and gaming performance then nitro and victus.;As people have mentioned previously, the main issue is due to unavailablity of iGPU which spoils the battery life. Overall a decent laptop and worth the price.I\u2019ll edit my comms after using it for a couple of months;This lap when fully charged shuts down in just one hour even with usage without the internet. I bought this gaming laptop expecting it's efficiency. But never expected such a low quality battery in such a new age laptop. What is the use of any technology if you can't use it. Imagine you buy a phone with all the latest technology from the top brand but battery dies  in qn 1 hour, will you buy? Even if it's given for free you won't use it. I wonder why companies even make such useless laptops. Horrible experience from Lenovo, never expected. I feel cheated and and have lost 80,000 I paid for this.;So far i am really satisfied with my Laptop. Yes there are some things that could have been better. Like the brightness could have been better. But the colour accuracy and all is good. The build is noce. Speaker quality is good not so bad but could have been better. It is on a heavier side but you know it is a gaming laptop. Many people complaint about the fan noise but i think most of the gaming laptops have this thing. It is just to keep your machine cool you can ignore that. The fan speed can be kept in quiet mode in normal usage. Battery life if you ask me lasted for 2.5-3hrs but i saw a minor charge drop while i was using heavily. 170w charger is not enough. J suggest you contact the customer care and get a 230w one. I bought it for \u20b969k during republic day sale. I think its worth every penny.;Everything is very good but battery is equally bad;After all settings down and in igpu mode and 60hz it around 4 hours itz pretty good but not sufficient for students i think \ud83e\udd14 70 wh ki battery deni chahiye inko",

There\u2019s absolutely no lag during use, even though I use it every day for work and general browsing. The battery life is impressive\u2014I've only had to replace the batteries once, which is a huge plus.The mouse itself is compact and fits comfortably in my hand, making it very easy to use for long periods without discomfort. Overall, it\u2019s a dependable, well-designed product that I\u2019d definitely recommend for everyday use;Everything is good and works like a charmm, feels heavy, useiing it almost 3 years. What i dislike about it is auto slleep while idle can be added within this price range.;I recently purchased the Lenovo 300 Wireless Compact Mouse, and I must say it has exceeded my expectations in several aspects. This compact and sleek mouse offers a great balance of functionality and portability, earning it a solid four-star rating.One of the standout features of this mouse is its compact design. It fits comfortably in my hand, and the low-profile design makes it easy to carry in my laptop bag without taking up much space. The compact form factor doesn't compromise functionality, as the buttons are well-placed and responsive.The wireless connectivity is reliable, and the setup was a breeze. The mouse connects seamlessly to my laptop without any noticeable lag, providing a hassle-free user experience. The wireless range is sufficient for my needs, and the included USB receiver can be conveniently stored in the mouse itself, reducing the risk of misplacement.The overall build quality of the Lenovo 300 is commendable. Despite its compact size, the mouse feels sturdy and durable. The click buttons have a satisfying tactile response, and the scroll wheel operates smoothly. The textured surface of the mouse provides a good grip, enhancing control during use.The battery life is impressive. With regular usage, I found that the mouse lasts for an extended period before needing a battery replacement. The automatic sleep mode further conserves battery life, and it quickly wakes up with a click when needed.While the Lenovo 300 is suitable for everyday use, it might not be the ideal choice for users with larger hands who prefer a fuller-sized mouse. Additionally, the lack of customizable buttons may be a drawback for those who rely on additional functionalities for specific tasks.;It's fake chinese product useless not working after 3 months and for warranty they do not have anything only on paper;Build quality- 5/5 (Shell is smooth, grippy, solid)Click quality- 5/5 (Tactile, Not too loud, rebound is good enough, perfect for office work)Click latency- 2/5 (Sometimes the first click immediately after an operation is delayed, but can get used to it)Scroll wheel- 3/5 (tactile stepped scrolls, scroll wheel itself is too smooth, cannot attest to the longevity of the scroll wheel)Battery Life - 4/5 (seems good so far, mostly irrelevant because it's a replaceable battery instead of a rechargeable battery; rechargeable batteries are worse for the environment and is a nuisance to charge compared to a standard AA battery)Tracking - Untested, It's good enough for office, don't know about tracking in games. Lift off Distance is fairly high (2-3cms).Mouse feet- Very smooth, not scratchy at all when paired with a mousepad.BIGGEST CON is that it does not auto turn off or sleep when inactive. So it's draining battery the whole time you leave it on. The issue with that is, using the ON/OFF toggle (located under the mouse) everyday would cause it to break. It will be the first breaking point of the mouse. The second might be the scroll wheel.Unfortunately I had no other option than a wireless mouse, but in this price bracket, if circumstances allow me, I would go for a wired office mouse.Otherwise, this is probably the best Wireless Mouse for in this range.;Mouse preciso, bonito e de qualidade comprovada, recomendo muito pra quem tem duvidas;Livr\u00e9 comme pr\u00e9vu, fonctionne comme pr\u00e9vu;I kept this mouse in my bag to go to uni and it was so handy to have something low cost, portable yet still a full mouse.

For a refurbished laptop, although looked clean, it was evident it was used a lot but since it's a refurbished laptop, it made sense. But here is where things went south, as soon as I turned the laptop ON, it saw the windows was not genuine version and was had many unwanted apps installed which was collecting data when connected to wifi. Coming from a tech background, I had a strong feeling there was official windows associated with this device, and I had reinstall windows using a USB drive and now it works flawless and no one is tracking anything!!So all in all, I can tell please reinstall windows if you want to use it safely.;I recently purchased this laptop, and it has exceeded my expectations in terms of value for money. The device arrived well-packaged with only minor cosmetic scratches, which are hardly noticeable. It performs smoothly for daily tasks, and the battery health is better than I anticipated for a refurbished model. The pre-installed software and updates worked seamlessly, saving me setup time. Overall, it\u2019s an excellent option for anyone looking for a budget-friendly yet reliable device, and I\u2019d highly recommend considering refurbished products for great savings.;My Laptop is very good condition and working very nice with only slot need change.battery and other components is very good performance.;I have purchased it recently, till now its working good and look wise is also good. Will update it fully after one month.;It was good for the price i bought it for 15000 only . The 16 gb variant . Battery backup is about 3-4 hours . It was being used for 2 years;The media could not be loaded.i reveived this on 13th january. the product was defective. i initiated return on same date. but no one came for pickup. i called to amazon support, they initiated the pickup again and same thing happend. I called to support of amazon again and same thing happend 3rd time also. At the end they said that I did not provide the pickup to the pickup partner. However its totally wrong. they neither called me nor came for return. Now my 15500 has been wasted because product is defective and of no use. Amazon support did not help at all and gave me stress and wasted my money and time. At the end they did not provide any report on pickup partner, no logs showed to me for return failed. Their pickup service is just worst. And did not refund my money. Hence, I strongly recommend to not to buy any electronic item from amazon. Worst experience ever.;Satisfied",

                "text": "The media could not be loaded.Reviewing  after 1 month of usages!! First I'm confused about this laptop because of the negative review ,it's a great laptop for basic use & for professionals.Pros--The build quality is good \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb,- the design is very sleek smooth- keyboard quality and keys are good, \u263a\ufe0f-Processor is beast very much satisfied ,-Battery life is also average max 4 hr to 5 hr depends on usages ,- lenovo service is so good I can say cause I noticed that my touchpad is sometimes lagging(coz of BIOS not uptodate) so I connect with the support team in lenovo offical website , he fixed it in just 10 mins! \u263a\ufe0fCONS-  Brightness is bit low have to set in 80 to100 range- speaker sound is average!- while charging the heating issue felt but not very much- only 60hrz refresh rate not satisfied- sometimes  display wombling not much but little- backlit light is  dim.Overall it'a good laptop \u2665\ufe0f 4.5/5If your priority is  not gaming or editingthen you can go for it! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb;Almost using it for 5 days :-Pros :- \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d.) Build quality\ud83d\udca5.) Display worth the money.) Battery life - I got 7.5 hrs with normal usage ( offline movies + YouTube + Browsing + Pdf reading) with Wifi and Bluetooth turned on all the time...I kept brightness at 30% ( since It is sufficient for me in indoors ) and in dark mode...Another time I got only 5.5 hrs of battery life...so not sure of the exact battery span..) Flip to start is very useful.) Booting time is only 10-15 secs max.) Performance is good for this budget.) Light weight and very convenient to use especially for studyingCons :- \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e.) Heating issue while charging\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8.) Sometimes it heats up even with normal usage.) Speaker is good but sound is low.) Missing fingerprint sensor/Facial recognition in this rangeTips :-.) Don't charge immediately after using for more hours...let the heat to cool down and then charge.) After charging let the heat to cool down..then start to use ( will Increase battery span )Product got delivered b4 the due date...and packaging was good \ud83d\udc4dConclusion : Simply go for it if you are a student and doesn't play that much of games\ud83d\udca5;Lightweight, good quality, high performance, good battery life and fast charging. I brought before 4 months and used for high performance programming. Over all its worth buying and truly made for developers.;I bought this laptop few days back. There was an issue with the screen so I had to return/replace it. The amazon guys has been lying from start. They said they were going to initiate a lenovo technician visit. I waited for 2 days, no one came so I called lenovo directly. They said they had no notification regarding any booking of technician visit.Once I booked the technician visit in lenovo's side a visit was arranged. In the meantime amazon kept telling me that their hands are tied as long as the product is not sealed by lenovo. Once lenoco technician checks the project and gives no objection for return we will return/replace it immediately. Now it has been almost 2 weeks, everyday a return is created and gets cancelled saying the product was not ready when actually no one visited.My biggest mistake was to buy it from amazon. The laptop is actually good. But directly from lenovo or may ve croma.;It's very slim , The build is plastic but it's very tough , the display is FHD and it's a good display, The processer is actually a beast but you need to use it on charging to utilise it's full capacity , battery backup despite of having a H series processor and 48W Battery it performs very well and give you a 5hr screen on time the sound isn't too loud but if you keep it on your lap or so then you won't face any issue , And the main keypoint of this laptop is it's i7 13gen processor which is very very powerful but remember it has a intel UHD graphics so you are not going to play any graphics involving games it won't be a smooth experience overall a good product for real;Great product. Got it for 43k so a sweet purchase.Few cons:No Type-C Charging \u2013 This is the biggest letdown.No Fingerprint Sensor \u2013 At this price point (60k), it's a noticeable omission.Can't Be Opened with One Hand \u2013 Not a dealbreaker, but it would have been a nice touch.Lid Feels a Bit Fragile \u2013 Possibly due to being too tight, making the lid feel delicate when opening.;Within 15 hours I got product after ordered, product build quality is very poor. You will not feel satisfaction after 56K spend. Other body quality is very poor and all core are sharp.Performance wise good because very hi fi processor and RAM.I will not recommend if you searching good and attractive body quality and  robust Laptop.;Have been using this for more than a month now.Everything about this laptop is perfect, The processor combines high power efficiency along with great performance, giving this laptop a good battery backup.16 GB ram is adequate and it can handle multitasking very well. The laptop starts up very quickly thanks to the SSD used.Design and finishing is perfect. Would recommend this to others.",

                "text": "The product is absolutely reliable and one need not hold any doubt on its utility. In my case the laptop would not switch on on arrival, I approached Edify and the product was picked up in 24 hours. The product was returned to me in 5 days after replacement of the battery. It's been a few months now and I am using it Delightedly. It is an ideal product for students who perforce have to purchase one during their scholastic days prior to seeking employment.;As of now it's working perfectly. It doesn't look like a refurbished one, seems like a new one. The only dispute which I noticed is the battery which is expected. Charge is draining faster than usual. Apart from that everything is perfect. Thanx to the seller as well as Amazon.After 1 month of usage the battery 2 is dead. It's not charging while the laptop is on charging mode. Contacted the seller multiple times but they are not in a mood to change the defected battery. They told me you have to send the defected battery by your own. That \"Used Yet New\" Seller is absolute a fraud one. Within a month after the delivery this thing happened. My product is under the 6-month seller warrenty but they are not helping the customer. Not getting a prompt solutions from Amazon also. They keep saying wait for 3 days for first time now saying 8 business days. Being a customer for a long time this is really disheartening. My suggestions would be don't buy refurbished one, not from that Used Yet New cheater.;The laptop delivers good overall performance with no major issues during use. It handles tasks efficiently and runs smoothly. However, the battery life is a bit disappointing, lasting only about 2 hours, which may require frequent charging. There are also a few minor scratches on the exterior, but they don't affect the laptop's functionality. If you're okay with the battery limitation, this laptop offers great value for its performance.;Don't even think of buying anything \"refurbished\". The entire thing is a scam.Nobody will respond if you face a problem.The build quality is flimsy, keys pop out automatically. The power supply has issues and the device turns off automatically even while it's plugged in. Display has visible dead pixels, I lodged a complaint with the seller, they didn't respond.Basically, once the return window is gone, Amazon won't listen and the seller won't respond. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.;Product is good. Value for money. Heat level is High. Keyboard functionalities are okay. Speed Is okay;The laptop arrived promptly, and the packaging was top-notch. The device itself is in pristine condition, performs smoothly, and looks brand new.What impressed me most was the warranty and after-sales support offered by EASYPC. They provide a comprehensive 6-month warranty and dedicated customer service, which gives me peace of mind.The price was unbeatable, and the quality exceeded my expectations. I've already recommended EASYPC to friends and family.If you're in the market for a refurbished laptop, look no further! EASYPC is the perfect choice.Pros:- Excellent customer support- Fast delivery- High-quality refurbished laptops- Unbeatable pricing- Comprehensive warrantyCons: NoneThanks !;Good quality and speed workingTotally satisfied thank you;The media could not be loaded.I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with the laptop I purchased. From the moment I unboxed it, it has been a constant source of frustration and inconvenience.The laptop is practically unusable. It freezes constantly, crashes frequently, and takes an eternity to boot up. I have tried all the troubleshooting steps suggested, but nothing seems to work.It is clear that this laptop is defective and not fit for purpose. I am appalled by the poor quality of this product and the negative impact it has had on my productivity. I demand a full refund and replacement with a functioning laptop. Customer support is not responding on calls and messagesI expect a prompt resolution to this matter.",

                "text": "The media could not be loaded.Reviewing  after 1 month of usages!! First I'm confused about this laptop because of the negative review ,it's a great laptop for basic use & for professionals.Pros--The build quality is good \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb,- the design is very sleek smooth- keyboard quality and keys are good, \u263a\ufe0f-Processor is beast very much satisfied ,-Battery life is also average max 4 hr to 5 hr depends on usages ,- lenovo service is so good I can say cause I noticed that my touchpad is sometimes lagging(coz of BIOS not uptodate) so I connect with the support team in lenovo offical website , he fixed it in just 10 mins! \u263a\ufe0fCONS-  Brightness is bit low have to set in 80 to100 range- speaker sound is average!- while charging the heating issue felt but not very much- only 60hrz refresh rate not satisfied- sometimes  display wombling not much but little- backlit light is  dim.Overall it'a good laptop \u2665\ufe0f 4.5/5If your priority is  not gaming or editingthen you can go for it! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb;Almost using it for 5 days :-Pros :- \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d.) Build quality\ud83d\udca5.) Display worth the money.) Battery life - I got 7.5 hrs with normal usage ( offline movies + YouTube + Browsing + Pdf reading) with Wifi and Bluetooth turned on all the time...I kept brightness at 30% ( since It is sufficient for me in indoors ) and in dark mode...Another time I got only 5.5 hrs of battery life...so not sure of the exact battery span..) Flip to start is very useful.) Booting time is only 10-15 secs max.) Performance is good for this budget.) Light weight and very convenient to use especially for studyingCons :- \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e.) Heating issue while charging\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8.) Sometimes it heats up even with normal usage.) Speaker is good but sound is low.) Missing fingerprint sensor/Facial recognition in this rangeTips :-.) Don't charge immediately after using for more hours...let the heat to cool down and then charge.) After charging let the heat to cool down..then start to use ( will Increase battery span )Product got delivered b4 the due date...and packaging was good \ud83d\udc4dConclusion : Simply go for it if you are a student and doesn't play that much of games\ud83d\udca5;Lightweight, good quality, high performance, good battery life and fast charging. I brought before 4 months and used for high performance programming. Over all its worth buying and truly made for developers.;I bought this laptop few days back. There was an issue with the screen so I had to return/replace it. The amazon guys has been lying from start. They said they were going to initiate a lenovo technician visit. I waited for 2 days, no one came so I called lenovo directly. They said they had no notification regarding any booking of technician visit.Once I booked the technician visit in lenovo's side a visit was arranged. In the meantime amazon kept telling me that their hands are tied as long as the product is not sealed by lenovo. Once lenoco technician checks the project and gives no objection for return we will return/replace it immediately. Now it has been almost 2 weeks, everyday a return is created and gets cancelled saying the product was not ready when actually no one visited.My biggest mistake was to buy it from amazon. The laptop is actually good. But directly from lenovo or may ve croma.;It's very slim , The build is plastic but it's very tough , the display is FHD and it's a good display, The processer is actually a beast but you need to use it on charging to utilise it's full capacity , battery backup despite of having a H series processor and 48W Battery it performs very well and give you a 5hr screen on time the sound isn't too loud but if you keep it on your lap or so then you won't face any issue , And the main keypoint of this laptop is it's i7 13gen processor which is very very powerful but remember it has a intel UHD graphics so you are not going to play any graphics involving games it won't be a smooth experience overall a good product for real;Great product. Got it for 43k so a sweet purchase.Few cons:No Type-C Charging \u2013 This is the biggest letdown.No Fingerprint Sensor \u2013 At this price point (60k), it's a noticeable omission.Can't Be Opened with One Hand \u2013 Not a dealbreaker, but it would have been a nice touch.Lid Feels a Bit Fragile \u2013 Possibly due to being too tight, making the lid feel delicate when opening.;Within 15 hours I got product after ordered, product build quality is very poor. You will not feel satisfaction after 56K spend. Other body quality is very poor and all core are sharp.Performance wise good because very hi fi processor and RAM.I will not recommend if you searching good and attractive body quality and  robust Laptop.;Have been using this for more than a month now.Everything about this laptop is perfect, The processor combines high power efficiency along with great performance, giving this laptop a good battery backup.16 GB ram is adequate and it can handle multitasking very well. The laptop starts up very quickly thanks to the SSD used.Design and finishing is perfect. Would recommend this to others.",

So yeah again normal-normal.Hardware is top notch, the keyboard quality is good.So all in all it is very good laptop, it will get all your normal needs done, go for it ,you will get it in 45k in sale.;Light weight easy to carry, good processor for day to day office work with home 11 and Ms office pre installed. Screen brightness is decent indoor but speaker is pathetic so not recommended for multimedia use case. If you want a laptop for office work with low budget below 50k go for it. I got it for 39k with bank office in great Indian sales and satisfied with it.;The product I received has issues with both hardware and software. The hardware is not functioning properly, and the software is also problematic. Additionally, the system is not working smoothly as expected. Please address these issues and provide a solution at the earliest.;battery drains fast runs only for 3.5 hrperformance is good but after 6-7 hrs of continuous use for study starts to lag and does not loadbuy for 32k through credit card and exchange offerotherwise don't  buy;After using it for a day -Display : pretty goodSpeakers - Below averageBattery life - GoodCamera - GoodPerformed well in dead pixel and keyboard functionality test.Overall amazing laptop for the price .....;Does my job without any hiccups. Happy with the purchase.;Quality and functionality is smooth.Seems best product and got it for 40k during the sale.Battery life is good.Camera quality and sound is just Ok.",

                "text": "The media could not be loaded.Reviewing  after 1 month of usages!! First I'm confused about this laptop because of the negative review ,it's a great laptop for basic use & for professionals.Pros--The build quality is good \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb,- the design is very sleek smooth- keyboard quality and keys are good, \u263a\ufe0f-Processor is beast very much satisfied ,-Battery life is also average max 4 hr to 5 hr depends on usages ,- lenovo service is so good I can say cause I noticed that my touchpad is sometimes lagging(coz of BIOS not uptodate) so I connect with the support team in lenovo offical website , he fixed it in just 10 mins! \u263a\ufe0fCONS-  Brightness is bit low have to set in 80 to100 range- speaker sound is average!- while charging the heating issue felt but not very much- only 60hrz refresh rate not satisfied- sometimes  display wombling not much but little- backlit light is  dim.Overall it'a good laptop \u2665\ufe0f 4.5/5If your priority is  not gaming or editingthen you can go for it! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb;Almost using it for 5 days :-Pros :- \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d.) Build quality\ud83d\udca5.) Display worth the money.) Battery life - I got 7.5 hrs with normal usage ( offline movies + YouTube + Browsing + Pdf reading) with Wifi and Bluetooth turned on all the time...I kept brightness at 30% ( since It is sufficient for me in indoors ) and in dark mode...Another time I got only 5.5 hrs of battery life...so not sure of the exact battery span..) Flip to start is very useful.) Booting time is only 10-15 secs max.) Performance is good for this budget.) Light weight and very convenient to use especially for studyingCons :- \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e.) Heating issue while charging\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8.) Sometimes it heats up even with normal usage.) Speaker is good but sound is low.) Missing fingerprint sensor/Facial recognition in this rangeTips :-.) Don't charge immediately after using for more hours...let the heat to cool down and then charge.) After charging let the heat to cool down..then start to use ( will Increase battery span )Product got delivered b4 the due date...and packaging was good \ud83d\udc4dConclusion : Simply go for it if you are a student and doesn't play that much of games\ud83d\udca5;Lightweight, good quality, high performance, good battery life and fast charging. I brought before 4 months and used for high performance programming. Over all its worth buying and truly made for developers.;I bought this laptop few days back. There was an issue with the screen so I had to return/replace it. The amazon guys has been lying from start. They said they were going to initiate a lenovo technician visit. I waited for 2 days, no one came so I called lenovo directly. They said they had no notification regarding any booking of technician visit.Once I booked the technician visit in lenovo's side a visit was arranged. In the meantime amazon kept telling me that their hands are tied as long as the product is not sealed by lenovo. Once lenoco technician checks the project and gives no objection for return we will return/replace it immediately. Now it has been almost 2 weeks, everyday a return is created and gets cancelled saying the product was not ready when actually no one visited.My biggest mistake was to buy it from amazon. The laptop is actually good. But directly from lenovo or may ve croma.;It's very slim , The build is plastic but it's very tough , the display is FHD and it's a good display, The processer is actually a beast but you need to use it on charging to utilise it's full capacity , battery backup despite of having a H series processor and 48W Battery it performs very well and give you a 5hr screen on time the sound isn't too loud but if you keep it on your lap or so then you won't face any issue , And the main keypoint of this laptop is it's i7 13gen processor which is very very powerful but remember it has a intel UHD graphics so you are not going to play any graphics involving games it won't be a smooth experience overall a good product for real;Great product. Got it for 43k so a sweet purchase.Few cons:No Type-C Charging \u2013 This is the biggest letdown.No Fingerprint Sensor \u2013 At this price point (60k), it's a noticeable omission.Can't Be Opened with One Hand \u2013 Not a dealbreaker, but it would have been a nice touch.Lid Feels a Bit Fragile \u2013 Possibly due to being too tight, making the lid feel delicate when opening.;Within 15 hours I got product after ordered, product build quality is very poor. You will not feel satisfaction after 56K spend. Other body quality is very poor and all core are sharp.Performance wise good because very hi fi processor and RAM.I will not recommend if you searching good and attractive body quality and  robust Laptop.;Have been using this for more than a month now.Everything about this laptop is perfect, The processor combines high power efficiency along with great performance, giving this laptop a good battery backup.16 GB ram is adequate and it can handle multitasking very well. The laptop starts up very quickly thanks to the SSD used.Design and finishing is perfect. Would recommend this to others.",

Highly Recommend to purchase.Powerful i5 9400 processor, No lag.I am fully satisfied.I purchased two Products,Both are working fine,no issue.;This Mini PC works like a charm and is smooth as well. Only downside is it doesn\u2019t have a bluetooth adapter so you have to buy it separately.I use it as a replacement to my laptop and it is serving my use quite well. I have upgraded the ram to 32GB and added a m2.nvme card as well. Blazing fast performance.;I was in search of a mini PC for my workbench and planned to build a setup using the 8GB DDR4 RAM sticks I already had. My initial plan was to buy a new barebone PC from brands like Intel or ASUS, add a 500GB SSD, and install Windows myself.While searching for components, I came across a Lenovo renewed PC at a decent price and decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, when the product arrived, it became clear that it wasn\u2019t \"renewed\" but rather modified.For example, the unit came with an external Wi-Fi dongle, which indicates the internal Wi-Fi card was either missing or faulty. This was disappointing because I expected a properly refurbished PC, not one with makeshift fixes.If I wanted a modified or patched-up PC, I would have done it myself. The whole point of buying a \"renewed\" product is to receive a fully restored and functioning unit, not a compromised one.;I ordered a (Refurbished) Lenovo ThinkCentre Desktop Mini PC (Intel Core i5 9th Gen",

Very small scratches but they\u2019re not visible even from 2ft.Looks like a value for money purchase!;So I had previously purchased a refurbised Dell 7040 micro PC and been using it for close to 1.5 years, and have been super happy with the product.I needed another one, so I thought I'll get another one and this one had the best processor among the other refurbished options (9th Gen processor) so I bought it.It came in, all neat and clean, I was happy about it. The thing is, it was running MUCH slower than the Dell PC which had a 6th gen processor. Startup would take like 3 minutes, wake up from sleep would take 2 mins... launching any program would take a really long time.I thought, Ok, they've cheaped out on the SSD and it is a super slow on. Tried testing the supplied SSD with crystal disk mark, it it ran fine versus the SSD in the 3 year older Dell PC. Anyways, I buy a 1 TB NVMe drive and install it, and while at it, bought another stick of RAM too as this comes with a single stick of RAM.Oh man, once I installed the new SSD, I did a clean install of Win 11, updated all the drivers and everything. This is where the problems started. Everytime the computer would start, it would either post and not boot (it would keep restarting). I put in the old SATA SSD and try to boot it, it would boot, login, and when I try to lauch a program, immediate power off and restart. Tried everything, different SSDs, swapped in new RAM, old RAM... nothing. Same issue, it would keep restarting.Then I did reading some reading and someone had suggested that the power supply might be the issue. And fair enough, the processor by itself has a TDP of 65W (i5 9600) and the power supply is rated for 65 W. No wonder it would keep restarting everytime it would try to drawing full power from the adaptor.Very frustrated... spent a full two days trying to debug it. This on top of the super slow stock SSD that it comes with... Now on, I'll stick to Dell Micro PCs...",

I am thoroughly impressed. The performance delivered by the Intel Evo Core Ultra 9 185H processor and the Intel Arc GPU is exceptional, handling intensive tasks with ease. The 14\" 2.8K-OLED display is a visual treat, offering vibrant colors and sharp details at a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. The laptop's build quality is top-notch, and it feels sturdy yet lightweight at just 1.4kg.The addition of built-in AI features enhances productivity, making tasks feel more intuitive. With 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD, multitasking and storage are a breeze. The FHD+ IR Camera ensures clear video calls, and the one-year ADP free service is a nice bonus. Overall, the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 excels in both performance and quality, making it a worthwhile investment.Applications used;If any problem comes. Amazon is worst than any retail shop. The app just keeps going in circle when you try to connect with customer service. From the internet I somehow connected to their customer service. But I felt sorry for them as they don't have any clear instructions. Lenovo gave a DOA and seal packed the laptop. More than three weeks now. I am left with DOA and seal packed laptop. My money is struck and no laptop to use.;After getting white screen innmy iphone 13 pro after 17.5.1 update I wanted to tell bye bye for apple products . So I was searching replacement for my macbook pro  since last 3 weeks . After researching a lot this one felt like a good choice in every aspects , display , performance, gaming .Having core ultra 9 is very good for any task , Intel arc graphics is integrated , but it's equivalent to 4gb graphics of 3050 series and pretty good . 32 gb ram is all enough for anything. First time in my life I never heard fan sound when Android studio running with emulator, which shows how good this laptop is in terms of performance. Played couple of games via game pass I got and they were good , but size of games are like 129 gb and all , that was surprising to me as I played games in laptop after years . But 1 tb SSD is all enough to have such 5 games . Battery life came 7 hours for me for mixed usage . As a security professional running kali linux in virtual box was very smooth and I didn't expect so much good performance for the price . So it's value for money. As by combining offers I got it around 86 k . It have amazing display and brightness, which even beats so called retina displays  . Totally satisfied with the choice i made.;The laptop has good build quality with full metal body, looks slik and professional much like Mac. I will go as far as calling it the Lenovo's MacBook.\ud83d\ude04 The display is fairly, would have been best if we did not get a lot of glare and reflection. Display is bright.However there are some minor cons are there to take away the 5th star. Heating is an issue with all laptops from this segment and this is not an exception, they did cost cut through build quality of Touch Pad and keyboard, the quality of both feels cheap. Last is the sound, well, don't expect much buy a good quality earphone.;I\u2019ve been using this laptop for a few weeks now, and I\u2019m thoroughly impressed with its performance! From the moment I powered it on, everything runs incredibly smooth. The speed is remarkable, whether I\u2019m multitasking with multiple apps, editing large files, or even gaming. The processor handles everything I throw at it without any signs of slowing down.The display is stunning\u2014sharp and vibrant, which makes working for long hours much easier on the eyes. Battery life is also a pleasant surprise, lasting me through a full day of heavy use without needing to recharge constantly. And the design? Sleek and modern, making it perfect for both work and play.Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a laptop that delivers in terms of speed, performance, and looks, this is an excellent choice. Definitely worth every penny! Highly recommended.;Given the configuration it is the best laptop. Performance is Excellent. Weight is light. I loved the Sound Quality. Ease of use. Boots within the blink of eye. The Build Quality is excellent. Original Product.;I checked a Asus Zenbook, and Vivobook models before finalizing on this model. The display is excellent, the CPU is top tier, and the form factor is perfect for portability. On a light to heavy workload I got about 4-5 hours of battery life. I ran about 4 VMs on VMWare Workstation, and still it stayed around 75-80 Deg. C. The build quality is good. This laptop, with a Intel Evo Core Ultra 9 185H is good value for money, esp. when the competition sells for more than 1.5L",

However, the next day I noticed that the laptop screen was experiencing backlight bleeding, meaning light was leaking from the edges of the panel, which is particularly noticeable on dark backgrounds. This is a manufacturing defect. Despite this, the Lenovo support team claimed it was normal and refused to replace the laptop or the screen. Additionally, the sound is very low\u2014you have to strain your ears to hear it. They said that was normal too. This seems to be the quality Lenovo offers, and I would advise against buying their products.

Latest Windows 11 Software2. 512 MB SSD / 8 GB RAM3. 15.6 inch FHD screen (would have been better with IPS display, but I was ok to compromise on this in favor of other features)4. Lifetime free Microsoft Office (no need to purchase separately)5. Backlit keyboard6. Tactile and smooth keys with very little travel and less sound7. Loud and Good Dolby Speakers, easy on the ears8. Good battery life (one charge can last upto 6-7 hours with medium usage of speakers and display brightness)9. AMD Ryzen 5 5500 : Very nifty and quick processor. The boot time is approx 3 secs, which is fast.This piece is good for office, music, movies and basic data analysis and games.Would definitely recommend to buy this laptop as it is value for money;I recently purchased the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 with the AMD Ryzen 5 5500U processor, and overall, I\u2019m quite impressed! The laptop\u2019s sleek design and lightweight build make it super portable, perfect for on-the-go use. The 15.6\" FHD display is vibrant and clear, providing a great viewing experience whether I\u2019m streaming shows or working on projects.The performance is solid thanks to the Ryzen 5 and 8GB of RAM. It handles everyday tasks like browsing, document editing, and even some light multitasking without any hiccups. The 512GB SSD is a huge plus, offering plenty of storage space and fast boot-up times.My only minor concerns are the battery life and the speakers. While it lasts a decent amount of time for daily use, I wish it could go a bit longer on a single charge. Additionally, the sound quality from the speakers is adequate but not exceptional, so I often use headphones for a better audio experience.Overall, the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 is a fantastic choice for students or professionals looking for a reliable, budget-friendly laptop. It combines performance and portability effectively, making it a great addition to my tech collection!;Very good quality;The media could not be loaded.I am a loyal Amazon prime customer and frequently buy products online. Off the late Amazon's post-delivery support has become worst especially on high-value products purchase. This incident has made me lose all the trust on purchasing high-value(>20,000 INR) electronics products online. The 7-Day replacement process is totally misleading and has become a great pain. Below is the detail incident.Amazon delivered this product \"Lenovo Ideapad-3\" on 06-JUL-2023, Thursday. After unpacking, I powered on the laptop and while going thru the initial settings, I found out that Keypad-1 on the keyboard was not working. This is clearly a hardware issue. So I went about the replacement process and was surprised to find out that first a technician from Amazon will arrive for an inspection and will try to resolve the issue. The technician did not arrive the next day and I had to reschedule again for the next day. So 2 days already lost. Finally the so called technician arrived on 09-JUL-2023, Sunday. The obvious expectation is that he will replace the non-working keypad and resolve. Instead he said he is there only for inspection of any damage and will install and run a diagnostic app which will check for software issues. This is so ridiculous given that the problem is with 1 keypad not working which is a hardware issue. The technician then took a video of the keypad not working and acknowledged the issue and left. I contacted Amazon support and they said that they were waiting for the report from technician and they will contact me after that. No one called anothe 2 days gone and I again followed up today 11-JUN-2023, Tuesday. Shockingly the Amazon support team informed me that the technician has filed a report that issue resolved which is a blatant lie. When I asked them to contact the technician, they were like as per the policy we cannot do that. I just don't understand what is the point in simply beating around the bush with this process and wasting customer's time and harassing the customer like this. Now they said they will arrange for another inspection from technician. This makes no sense as the issue is clearly with hardware. So at the time of writing its 6 days and I am sitting idle with the laptop. The whole point of ordering online is that 7 days replacement guarantee and the confidence. Instead Amazon support simply doing CUSTOMER HARASSMENT and misleading a loyal prime customer. Now I have to wait for the second so called technician to come and not sure what exactly he will do and have no idea as to when the replacement will be done. When we pay the money up-front the expectation is that service and support will work like that. Instead Amazon support is taking CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR GRANTED.After this incident from here-on, I believe a local retailer is far better when it comes to customer support and accountability. Should NEVER BY A HIGH VALUE PRODUCT ONLINE and 7 DAYS REPLACEMENT PROCESS FROM AMAZON IS TURNING TO A HOAX.;BEST PRODUCT;Camera quality is poorSound is goodAMD processor is fastThree modes are there - battery saver , best performance and thermal cooling (Fn+Q)Battery backup is ok not for gamingBacklit keyboard -2 level of brightnessWhen u open the lid the system will power on, u need not to on the power buttonDisplay is good with good brightnessMany shortcut keys are there at the top of the keyboardSomething the keyboard is not working, I don't know the reason..but try to remove the usb pin plugged in if anyCorrect buy at this price 44k",

I used a stand to attach it firmly to my table.It came with an HDMI port so I didn't have to use a DP converter.I was not used to Windows 11 and ended up starting a microsoft account (the windows 11 start button is in the centre of the task bar and the microsoft account start button is on the extreme left). Microsoft account blocks alot of activities so avoid creating one without studying the issue.The windows 11 installed is well tailored without any bloatware.The mini pc is working excellently and I hope it continues to do so for a reasonable time. I have registered for the 6 months warranty too.Presently using it for simple browsing,  playing music videos, youtube and some business storage. Have not used for gaming, so can't comment on that.I am also using a Gotega DVD CD reader writer AND Seagate external hard drive (1TB) simultaneously with the mini pc and there is very good transfer speed considering the size of the medical case records.Overall Lenova Mini is a better investment than new assembled PCs I have owned in the past, which often gave problems initially.;Writing this review after 1 days use. Its very small CPU like a TV set top box. Working fine,No issue. There is no HDMI or VGA outpur only Display Ports are available. So you have to buy DP to HDMI cable to this setup.;Seller name:- Used yet new dot comMahesh Reddy, who is a worker at seller, he called me and asked to give a 5 star rating that he can send a free laptop bag, so after giving a 5 start rating he isn't responding. So updating the reviewLooks like a brand new mini pc, under the body is looks dull in colour. May be powder coated body.CPU stand/box/mount is not included with the box.Compat in size and saves space,  serves most of all works like Watching movies, listing to the songs, photo or video editing, MS Excel, etc.1)All USB ports, Audio ports, DP portes are working in good condition.2)Power adapter and the dp cable was brand new. But DP cable fits loose and provides a blurry screen.3)Instead of wifi dongle they gave wifi port, so saved 1 USB space, thanks to the seller for providing wifi port. But the wifi is keeps disconnecting and having issue with the driver also.4) smoother operation, but lags some times even with 8GB Ram.5) value for money points:- 3 points out of 10.6) Booting takes long time.Overall i want to say that.Buy this unit if you have kids in home or learning purpose only.;I\u2019m extremely impressed with this refurbished PC! It\u2019s fast, reliable, and handles multitasking effortlessly. The design is sleek, and it stays cool even during heavy use. Highly recommend it for anyone seeking top-notch performance and style at a great value!;The Power cable which connects to the voltage adaptor was faulty, initially i tot it CPU was Faulty. We connected with Different Power cable and the CPU booted, Windows was genuine, Office Was genuine, The CPU can Easily run Programmers like AutoCAD, opens and processes Heavy files decently.its a Bang for your money if you get a decent Piece.;Nice product, Value for money, Talented Customer care staff;Best CPU for office use;No USB 3.0, The wifi is disabled by default, there is no hdmi or vga, only DP port which most monitors dont support. There is also no easy return and refund. In short do not buy this garbage. The sellers are cheating people.",

                "text": "The quality of the laptop is really good for a refurbished laptop. Till now I have not seen any issue. Looks brand new and works perfectly. In the inital use it looks like a real value for money. With 6 months of warranty, hope the laptop doesnt need that.Great product at good price;Received defective and different piece. Battery is not charging and laptop version is also different than described.I requested for return and even after waiting for 20 days, no one came to pickup and Amazon rejected the refund now and asking me to contact service center.;In good condition and works well and fast. Support guys are also responsive. Would recommend this seller.;I recently took the plunge and swapped out my old 2020 MacBook Air (which sadly bit the dust) for a refurbished ThinkPad T480. I've always been a sucker for the ThinkPad aesthetic, and while I was tempted to get a brand new E14, I realized I didn\u2019t need that much horsepower for what I use a laptop for. My heavy lifting is done on my workstation, so I just needed a reliable machine for productivity on the go. I even flirted with the idea of buying a Chromebook, but Chrome OS doesn\u2019t really do it for me. So, a refurbished T480 seemed like the perfect middle ground.First off, I have to say, I\u2019m impressed with the overall performance. The 8th Gen i5 8550u (quad-core) still has plenty of kick, and honestly, I\u2019ve heard the i7 version tends to throttle, which can actually make it slower in real-world use. So, unless you\u2019re into just collecting high numbers on a spec sheet, the i5 is definitely the way to go. I am a student, and do remote work as an author and editorial manager, so most of my work consists of Google Docs, 200 or so Chrome tabs for research, Notion for note-taking, etc. In a nutshell, most of it is done in the browser, but if you know anything about how bloated browsers are nowadays, you know that it can get quite intensive(Yes using Brave would be a little better, but for circumstances, I have to use Chrome).As for gaming, I'm not that much of a gamer, stuff like Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves seem to run so-so, and Minecraft runs surprisingly well, something that I didn't expect out of an 8th gen mobile CPU. Normal MC with default settings gives >60 frames and with Optifine and other performance-enhancing mods ~75 is possible. As for modpacks, even the >200 mod modpacks run at ~30fps which is quite good for a laptop. Of course, all of this gaming performance is in performance mode while plugged into a socket, not in battery saver or balanced mode.But let\u2019s pause here for a moment because I HAVE to gush about the keyboard. Holy. Freaking. Wow. I knew ThinkPads had a rep for their keyboards, but experiencing it firsthand is a whole new level of awesome. The T480\u2019s keyboard is hands-down, without a doubt, the best keyboard I\u2019ve ever typed on. The keys are perfectly spaced, with just the right amount of travel and feedback. Typing on this thing is an absolute joy. If your job consists of mainly typing stuff then you will be in heaven.Now, let\u2019s talk about the hiccups. The T480 has this dual battery setup, right? One internal, one external. The idea is great for extended battery life, but for some reason, mine only recognizes the external 24Wh battery. In the eyes of the OS the internal doesn't seem to even doesn\u2019t exist. I\u2019ve tried different operating systems, and updated drivers, but... Nothing. It\u2019s a bummer because the battery life could be so much better if both were working. I\u2019m hesitant to crack open the chassis to check it out myself because that would void the warranty from the refurbishers.On the plus side, the touchscreen is pretty responsive. There\u2019s a slightly dodgy patch in the top right corner, but it\u2019s not a dealbreaker. It's a reminder that this isn\u2019t a pristine, fresh-out-of-the-box device, but at a fraction of the price of a new MacBook, I can live with a few quirks.In the end, if you\u2019re even remotely tech-savvy and don\u2019t mind doing a bit of tinkering, refurbished products like this T480 are a fantastic option. Sure, it might not have that shiny, perfect Apple feel, but it also doesn\u2019t come with the shiny, perfect Apple price tag. For me, it\u2019s all about bang for the buck, and this T480 delivers on that front. It\u2019s robust, reliable, and gets the job done without any fuss. Just keep an eye on those battery issues, and you\u2019re golden.;Perfect leptop \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d;Very Nice product . All specifications on Amazon where same in laptop. Touch screen is fully functional. Battery Health is good . There are no scratches visible from 30cm . Overall very fine product . Post delivery costomer service is awesome as per my experience.;Test your Batteries, it's always an issue with refurbished laptops. Can't expect a new battery, but should have decent backup. My battery on first charge lasted for about 40 min....  The seller (New Jaisa) claims to have the best quality checks in the country wonder how they missed a faulty battery on this laptop. Or may be a marketing gimmick.My ThinkPad T480 was suppose to have an internal and external battery.The internal battery was reported as not installed and external one failed the test on vendors website.Initiated a return.;The media could not be loaded.Delivered as Promised by the committed Date. Happy with the Impeccable Condition and Smooth Working. I have used it for last 5 days and working absolutely to the Expectations. So far So Good. Does not look like the Refurbished piece.  I am Happy with my decision to go for the Refurbished Piece and I expect it serves my intended purpose.

It is superfast as well. I can transfer a 1000 photos and videos from my phone to this drive in under a minute. That's impressive. It looks much better than the samsung T7 too. The only downside is since it has a metal body it gets hot with even 5 minutes of use. Maybe that's why the later T7 model and the T9 use a rubber body. But for 6k I don't have a problem with that.

But I upgraded with 8gbx2=16gb crucial ram, 500gb samsung 970 evo plus and 9th gen i5 9400 processor.  This is Working at lighting speed which is more than enough for people Working in machine learning field. No GPU is required. But I have not tested for gaming because I didn't play any. I am using it as a substitute for laptop. Because it is more convenient to carry from college to home and at both places, I have wireless mouse, keyboard and monitor. It's serving my purpose.  Instead of a powerful laptop at rs.60000, I  am using it at the price of rs. 20000 after upgradation. Don't think that it must be upgraded. Without upgradation also, It's more powerful for regular student, office and home work. Since I am doing PhD, upgraded....Thanks;I purchased the product on 27.12.2023. For six months it worked fine. After passing of six months, certain problems started to occur. Today, On 04.12.2024, it completely stopped working. When I have it checked from a Computer expert, it has been found out that there is issue in the working of Mother Board which cannot be resolved at all.;This mini PC is a solid choice for basic tasks like word processing, spreadsheets, and web browsing. It's compact and efficient, perfect for those who need a small-footprint computer.Pros:Compact Design: Takes up minimal space, ideal for small setups.Performance: Handles basic tasks like MS Word, Excel, and web surfing without issues.Quiet Operation: Doesn't generate excessive noise, making it suitable for quiet environments.Cons:Limited Upgradability: May not be suitable for gaming or demanding applications.Storage: Might require external storage for large files or media.Conclusion: If you're looking for a reliable and affordable mini PC for everyday tasks, this is a good option. It offers a decent balance of performance and portability.;This is my secound purchase as i am satisfied for my office work;Thank You Recyclekart and amazon.It's absolutely fine product without any issue. Even it's working well.If it comes with HDMI PORT, it will be the master blaster.Overall rating 10 out of 9.5;The display port is damaged and slightly broken  and there is no vga port;Its almost 3 weeks now I have been using this and so far am happy with the purchase.I was a little hesitant in purchasing the product but after some research into it, i finally prepared myself and ordered it. Performance wise I would say it is good and much above my expectations for home pc and I would recommend to go for \"Refurb-PC\" seller as the product was quickly shipped and was well received in a excellent packing from the seller with all required accessories. It seems like brand new and It feels like the device was deep cleaned and polished as well. The only problem was that the wifi reception module antenna at the back of the device was damaged or taken off apart from this the PC works like charm and boots up merely in 15 seconds or so. This has been one of my best purchases on Amazon and thank you Refurb-PC .ThanksDavinder Singh;I was blown away by the lenova tiny size machine performance and features, considering its tiny size! It's perfect for basic tasks like browsing, streaming, and office work. The machine is also remarkably quiet and energy-efficient. While it may not be suitable for heavy gaming or video editing, it's an excellent choice for those seeking a compact, reliable, and affordable desktop solution.Highly recommended for:- Home users with limited space- Students and professionals needing a basic desktop- Anyone seeking a budget-friendly, hassle-free computing experienceNot recommended for:- Heavy gamers or content creators- Those requiring extensive upgradability and customization options",

I am thoroughly impressed. The performance delivered by the Intel Evo Core Ultra 9 185H processor and the Intel Arc GPU is exceptional, handling intensive tasks with ease. The 14\" 2.8K-OLED display is a visual treat, offering vibrant colors and sharp details at a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. The laptop's build quality is top-notch, and it feels sturdy yet lightweight at just 1.4kg.The addition of built-in AI features enhances productivity, making tasks feel more intuitive. With 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD, multitasking and storage are a breeze. The FHD+ IR Camera ensures clear video calls, and the one-year ADP free service is a nice bonus. Overall, the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 excels in both performance and quality, making it a worthwhile investment.Applications used;If any problem comes. Amazon is worst than any retail shop. The app just keeps going in circle when you try to connect with customer service. From the internet I somehow connected to their customer service. But I felt sorry for them as they don't have any clear instructions. Lenovo gave a DOA and seal packed the laptop. More than three weeks now. I am left with DOA and seal packed laptop. My money is struck and no laptop to use.;After getting white screen innmy iphone 13 pro after 17.5.1 update I wanted to tell bye bye for apple products . So I was searching replacement for my macbook pro  since last 3 weeks . After researching a lot this one felt like a good choice in every aspects , display , performance, gaming .Having core ultra 9 is very good for any task , Intel arc graphics is integrated , but it's equivalent to 4gb graphics of 3050 series and pretty good . 32 gb ram is all enough for anything. First time in my life I never heard fan sound when Android studio running with emulator, which shows how good this laptop is in terms of performance. Played couple of games via game pass I got and they were good , but size of games are like 129 gb and all , that was surprising to me as I played games in laptop after years . But 1 tb SSD is all enough to have such 5 games . Battery life came 7 hours for me for mixed usage . As a security professional running kali linux in virtual box was very smooth and I didn't expect so much good performance for the price . So it's value for money. As by combining offers I got it around 86 k . It have amazing display and brightness, which even beats so called retina displays  . Totally satisfied with the choice i made.;The laptop has good build quality with full metal body, looks slik and professional much like Mac. I will go as far as calling it the Lenovo's MacBook.\ud83d\ude04 The display is fairly, would have been best if we did not get a lot of glare and reflection. Display is bright.However there are some minor cons are there to take away the 5th star. Heating is an issue with all laptops from this segment and this is not an exception, they did cost cut through build quality of Touch Pad and keyboard, the quality of both feels cheap. Last is the sound, well, don't expect much buy a good quality earphone.;I\u2019ve been using this laptop for a few weeks now, and I\u2019m thoroughly impressed with its performance! From the moment I powered it on, everything runs incredibly smooth. The speed is remarkable, whether I\u2019m multitasking with multiple apps, editing large files, or even gaming. The processor handles everything I throw at it without any signs of slowing down.The display is stunning\u2014sharp and vibrant, which makes working for long hours much easier on the eyes. Battery life is also a pleasant surprise, lasting me through a full day of heavy use without needing to recharge constantly. And the design? Sleek and modern, making it perfect for both work and play.Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a laptop that delivers in terms of speed, performance, and looks, this is an excellent choice. Definitely worth every penny! Highly recommended.;Given the configuration it is the best laptop. Performance is Excellent. Weight is light. I loved the Sound Quality. Ease of use. Boots within the blink of eye. The Build Quality is excellent. Original Product.;I checked a Asus Zenbook, and Vivobook models before finalizing on this model. The display is excellent, the CPU is top tier, and the form factor is perfect for portability. On a light to heavy workload I got about 4-5 hours of battery life. I ran about 4 VMs on VMWare Workstation, and still it stayed around 75-80 Deg. C. The build quality is good. This laptop, with a Intel Evo Core Ultra 9 185H is good value for money, esp. when the competition sells for more than 1.5L",

So for correcting that log in Lenovo support and register yourself with the serial no. of laptop.Intel i5 12450H provides a high performance.1080p camera which is very good.1.5Wx2 speakers with a very loud sound.No heating issues.Battery life is good as per the processor oh H series.Another thing is that it doesn't have fingerprint sensor. So don't buy this laptop for sake of fingerprint Sensor.Conclusion -:Great laptop with great performance. Absolutely value for money. With great IPS display screen.;I recently purchased the Lenovo Slim 3 laptop and here are my thoughts on this device:Pros:Performance: The laptop boasts an impressive Intel Core i5 H series processor. It handles multitasking and daily computing tasks effortlessly, making it a reliable choice for both work and casual use.Display: Display quality is averageKeyboard, Webcam, and Touchpad Quality: The keyboard is comfortable and responsive, the webcam delivers clear video quality, and the touchpad is smooth and accurate.AI Features: The AI features are a welcome addition, enhancing the overall user experience with smart and intuitive functionalities.Slimpad 5 Series Features: This laptop includes the latest features from the Slimpad 5 series, adding extra value and usability.Bundled Software: The device comes with Microsoft Office Home 2021 with lifetime validity, a 3-month Xbox Game Pass subscription, and a 1-month McAfee antivirus trial. Activation of these was straightforward and hassle-free.Warranty Activation: Activating the warranty was a smooth and easy process, providing additional peace of mind.Cons:Fingerprint Sensor Issue: Despite the laptop having a fingerprint sensor, I encountered an issue where it cannot be activated. The message \"We cannot find a fingerprint scanner compatible with Windows Hello Fingerprint\" appears, making this feature unusable.Graphics Card: The Intel UHD graphics card is below average for high-intensity, high-end gaming. Gamers looking for robust graphics performance might be disappointed.Build Quality: The build quality is mixed.

                "text": "Very good laptop. Don't focus on other reviews. Just take a time to read this.**The most important thing- The warranty of the laptop may have started before. So for correcting that log in Lenovo support and register yourself with the serial no. of laptop.Intel i5 12450H provides a high performance.1080p camera which is very good.1.5Wx2 speakers with a very loud sound.No heating issues.Battery life is good as per the processor oh H series.Another thing is that it doesn't have fingerprint sensor. So don't buy this laptop for sake of fingerprint Sensor.Conclusion -:Great laptop with great performance. Absolutely value for money. With great IPS display screen.;I recently purchased the Lenovo Slim 3 laptop and here are my thoughts on this device:Pros:Performance: The laptop boasts an impressive Intel Core i5 H series processor. It handles multitasking and daily computing tasks effortlessly, making it a reliable choice for both work and casual use.Display: Display quality is averageKeyboard, Webcam, and Touchpad Quality: The keyboard is comfortable and responsive, the webcam delivers clear video quality, and the touchpad is smooth and accurate.AI Features: The AI features are a welcome addition, enhancing the overall user experience with smart and intuitive functionalities.Slimpad 5 Series Features: This laptop includes the latest features from the Slimpad 5 series, adding extra value and usability.Bundled Software: The device comes with Microsoft Office Home 2021 with lifetime validity, a 3-month Xbox Game Pass subscription, and a 1-month McAfee antivirus trial. Activation of these was straightforward and hassle-free.Warranty Activation: Activating the warranty was a smooth and easy process, providing additional peace of mind.Cons:Fingerprint Sensor Issue: Despite the laptop having a fingerprint sensor, I encountered an issue where it cannot be activated. The message \"We cannot find a fingerprint scanner compatible with Windows Hello Fingerprint\" appears, making this feature unusable.Graphics Card: The Intel UHD graphics card is below average for high-intensity, high-end gaming. Gamers looking for robust graphics performance might be disappointed.Build Quality: The build quality is mixed. While the front build quality is good, the base of the laptop feels like it is made from low-grade plastic, which seems less durable. Additionally, the screen tends to shake when typing quickly, which can be distracting.In summary, the Lenovo Slim 3 is a solid laptop with great performance, high-quality keyboard, webcam, and touchpad, and useful AI features.

The AMD Ryzen processor is strong enough for regular use at home.As opposed to what many mention, the laptop does come with a backlit keyboard.There is a pre-installed Microsoft Office also ready to use. Just have to create an account if you don't have one and login.;Okay review after 3 months ? 2 months ? Idk I forgot anyways, the laptop is bigger than you'd expect, slim, light, above average performance!Pros :Back-lit keyboardAccessibility is numerous,Ryzen Processor > IntelDisplay : LargeColour contrast : Vibrant Colour, FHDCharging takes less time !Value for money ? Big yes !(Better than Ausus, HP, sorry not sorry but all my families use different laptop that's much pricier than this laptop but it outperforms ausus vivobook, hp)Cons :\u2022 Not for heavy gaming as it drains quiet fast when you play games on it ( on 100% it drained quiet fast when I played DOTA)\u2022 Bluetooth tend to stop working when you're using a wireless mouse/keyboard and Bluetooth earbuds both connected to the laptop (you have to disconnect either the ear buds or the mouse)Camera : TRASH (Sorry not sorry)Conclusion: Dont play heavy games, good for academic works ( if you're not a developer don't stress on it but learn python at the least lol )Should you buy it ?Yes, if it's well within your budget(It's better than vivobook :D);I bought this Lenovo Ideapad laptop 3 months ago and after use of less than 2 months battery is not taking charge. I called the Amazon customer care they told me to contact Lenovo customer care for support. And when I called Lenovo customer care they checked the laptop virtually by taker controls from Rescue Lens application and found that there is a issue with battery. And after 3-4 days one of their technician come to replace the battery and after replacing the battery issue still remains same. Then he troubleshooted and told us that its motherboard having issues so they have to replace motherboard. I asked them to replace full unit but they are denying. I again called the customer care of lenovo but they are denying to replace the unit. Also, when I bought this unit I found that the warranty on site shows expired. I think these lenovo company guys are so unprofessional and there is no management and quality check of the products.  At last I want to say please dont buy this product its unreliable.....Its waste of money.;Works excellentHas all featuresBattery works for good 5-6 hours on continuous working and watching video.Very smooth and sleek.Value for money.;;It doesn't have backlit keyboard but the device performance is efficient. Loads windows under 10 secs and no log observed so far. The sound quality is really good.;Every thing is good but you can not control blacklit keyboard intensity light. You can just turn it on or off. You can't change it to low, medium and high. And fingerprint senseor is not compatible for the hello window is showing.Good pointsPerformance is goodBattery is goodBad pointsYou can't ajust the light of keyboard. But you can it on/offFingerprint senor is not working error is showing.;Really good product from Lenovo. Awesome backlit. Very good display.",

But I upgraded with 8gbx2=16gb crucial ram, 500gb samsung 970 evo plus and 9th gen i5 9400 processor.  This is Working at lighting speed which is more than enough for people Working in machine learning field. No GPU is required. But I have not tested for gaming because I didn't play any. I am using it as a substitute for laptop. Because it is more convenient to carry from college to home and at both places, I have wireless mouse, keyboard and monitor. It's serving my purpose.  Instead of a powerful laptop at rs.60000, I  am using it at the price of rs. 20000 after upgradation. Don't think that it must be upgraded. Without upgradation also, It's more powerful for regular student, office and home work. Since I am doing PhD, upgraded....Thanks;I purchased the product on 27.12.2023. For six months it worked fine. After passing of six months, certain problems started to occur. Today, On 04.12.2024, it completely stopped working. When I have it checked from a Computer expert, it has been found out that there is issue in the working of Mother Board which cannot be resolved at all.;This mini PC is a solid choice for basic tasks like word processing, spreadsheets, and web browsing. It's compact and efficient, perfect for those who need a small-footprint computer.Pros:Compact Design: Takes up minimal space, ideal for small setups.Performance: Handles basic tasks like MS Word, Excel, and web surfing without issues.Quiet Operation: Doesn't generate excessive noise, making it suitable for quiet environments.Cons:Limited Upgradability: May not be suitable for gaming or demanding applications.Storage: Might require external storage for large files or media.Conclusion: If you're looking for a reliable and affordable mini PC for everyday tasks, this is a good option. It offers a decent balance of performance and portability.;This is my secound purchase as i am satisfied for my office work;Thank You Recyclekart and amazon.It's absolutely fine product without any issue. Even it's working well.If it comes with HDMI PORT, it will be the master blaster.Overall rating 10 out of 9.5;The display port is damaged and slightly broken  and there is no vga port;Its almost 3 weeks now I have been using this and so far am happy with the purchase.I was a little hesitant in purchasing the product but after some research into it, i finally prepared myself and ordered it. Performance wise I would say it is good and much above my expectations for home pc and I would recommend to go for \"Refurb-PC\" seller as the product was quickly shipped and was well received in a excellent packing from the seller with all required accessories. It seems like brand new and It feels like the device was deep cleaned and polished as well. The only problem was that the wifi reception module antenna at the back of the device was damaged or taken off apart from this the PC works like charm and boots up merely in 15 seconds or so. This has been one of my best purchases on Amazon and thank you Refurb-PC .ThanksDavinder Singh;I was blown away by the lenova tiny size machine performance and features, considering its tiny size! It's perfect for basic tasks like browsing, streaming, and office work. The machine is also remarkably quiet and energy-efficient. While it may not be suitable for heavy gaming or video editing, it's an excellent choice for those seeking a compact, reliable, and affordable desktop solution.Highly recommended for:- Home users with limited space- Students and professionals needing a basic desktop- Anyone seeking a budget-friendly, hassle-free computing experienceNot recommended for:- Heavy gamers or content creators- Those requiring extensive upgradability and customization options",

If your budget is around 43k, you search ends here;Worst experience with lenovoI have puchased this product with very hopefulBut the product was delivered with defective Display edges are blinking with light,mouse touch also not sit properly and top body also not sit properly with bottom bodyI received a fully defective productAnd the last the seller not provided replacement because the product was out of stock then what can i doI want a replacement or refund from the seller and alsoWorst experience with this sellerLastly i trusted lenovo laptop because it is a worlds no.1 brand but this lenovo company fully disappointed me with my 1st lenovo laptop..;I needed lappy in 40k range, being lil bit of geek, i prefer AMD ryzen over intel ones, so i zeroed on 2 processors first 5500u , but then a better one was in range due to this item thinkbook 16 g6, 16 inch, ryzen5 7530u. far better performance than average guy like me needs, and i play occasional games too, not too much,but i kept gaming performance in mind too. this was at 42,990 price a week back, got for 41k with credit card, when i got it. perfect delivery,perfect product, not even a single problem , and on promised day. using it for week, getting almost 10 hour backup on battery saving mode while using only for MSoffice word and excel tasks. and even with 1 hour of continuous use with projector ( not for movies, only for ms word screen projection). for some reason, all on net search too,i found dolby works with speakers but not for bluetooth headfones. but using fxsound app from ms store, great sound for music . now price is 49k on amazon, but ram is upgradable to 64 gb, so still value for money i guess, future proof more than others.;I recently purchased this 16-inch Lenovo laptop from Amazon and have had a mix of experiences. The fingerprint login is impressively fast, and the larger screen is a welcome upgrade from my previous 15.6-inch laptop. However, I've encountered some minor issues that might be deal-breakers for some.Pros:* Swift Fingerprint Login: The fingerprint sensor is quick and reliable.* Excellent Display: The larger screen offers a more immersive viewing experience.* Bright Backlight: The backlight is sufficiently bright for comfortable viewing in various lighting conditions.* Excellent Linux Compatibility: AMD's superior GPU drivers make this a great choice for Linux users.Cons:* Subpar Speaker Volume: The speakers are quite soft, making it difficult to hear audio clearly, especially in noisy environments.* Average Battery Life: The battery life is around 5 hours, which may not be sufficient for all-day use without a charger.* Touchpad Placement: The touchpad is slightly off-center, which might take some getting used to for some users.* Slight Backlight Bleed: There's a minor backlight bleed issue on the left bottom side, noticeable when viewing a black screen in full screen mode.Despite these drawbacks, this Lenovo laptop offers a decent overall experience, particularly for Linux users who appreciate a larger screen and fast fingerprint login. However, potential buyers should carefully consider the speaker volume, battery life, and touchpad placement before making a decision.",

The AMD Ryzen processor is strong enough for regular use at home.As opposed to what many mention, the laptop does come with a backlit keyboard.There is a pre-installed Microsoft Office also ready to use. Just have to create an account if you don't have one and login.;Okay review after 3 months ? 2 months ? Idk I forgot anyways, the laptop is bigger than you'd expect, slim, light, above average performance!Pros :Back-lit keyboardAccessibility is numerous,Ryzen Processor > IntelDisplay : LargeColour contrast : Vibrant Colour, FHDCharging takes less time !Value for money ? Big yes !(Better than Ausus, HP, sorry not sorry but all my families use different laptop that's much pricier than this laptop but it outperforms ausus vivobook, hp)Cons :\u2022 Not for heavy gaming as it drains quiet fast when you play games on it ( on 100% it drained quiet fast when I played DOTA)\u2022 Bluetooth tend to stop working when you're using a wireless mouse/keyboard and Bluetooth earbuds both connected to the laptop (you have to disconnect either the ear buds or the mouse)Camera : TRASH (Sorry not sorry)Conclusion: Dont play heavy games, good for academic works ( if you're not a developer don't stress on it but learn python at the least lol )Should you buy it ?Yes, if it's well within your budget(It's better than vivobook :D);I bought this Lenovo Ideapad laptop 3 months ago and after use of less than 2 months battery is not taking charge. I called the Amazon customer care they told me to contact Lenovo customer care for support. And when I called Lenovo customer care they checked the laptop virtually by taker controls from Rescue Lens application and found that there is a issue with battery. And after 3-4 days one of their technician come to replace the battery and after replacing the battery issue still remains same. Then he troubleshooted and told us that its motherboard having issues so they have to replace motherboard. I asked them to replace full unit but they are denying. I again called the customer care of lenovo but they are denying to replace the unit. Also, when I bought this unit I found that the warranty on site shows expired. I think these lenovo company guys are so unprofessional and there is no management and quality check of the products.  At last I want to say please dont buy this product its unreliable.....Its waste of money.;Works excellentHas all featuresBattery works for good 5-6 hours on continuous working and watching video.Very smooth and sleek.Value for money.;;It doesn't have backlit keyboard but the device performance is efficient. Loads windows under 10 secs and no log observed so far. The sound quality is really good.;Every thing is good but you can not control blacklit keyboard intensity light. You can just turn it on or off. You can't change it to low, medium and high. And fingerprint senseor is not compatible for the hello window is showing.Good pointsPerformance is goodBattery is goodBad pointsYou can't ajust the light of keyboard. But you can it on/offFingerprint senor is not working error is showing.;Really good product from Lenovo. Awesome backlit. Very good display.",

It has touch screen and after opening the laptos we don't need to press the power button it automatically it opens its self and touch response is really good and fast and also fingerprint sensor is also have fast response. Go for it.... value for money product, display is also great, also light weight and yes build quality is awesome.;Very happy i5 1235u 16 gb soldered ram and 512gb ssd , pen with office 2021 win 11 upgraded to latest. 50k in sale. Everything's up and running. The build quality has a flaw that can break the touch screen anytime.;Please don't buy this \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I have faced the issue in turning on and after 2 months of using it didn't turned on and technical support from the company technician came and said that mother board is complaint. Then he came with the used motherboard board which looked like used one shared the images. We request not to buy this product and u will be fooled. Lenovo customer support is very bad and they will not be saving you from these issue. As I had a warranty period they need to replace new motherboard but they didn't do that. My suggestion to everyone to be with the technician and look how they get service and replace spares. You will be fooled by them once if they replace old parts laptop will get damaged and need to spend lots of money \ud83e\udd11\ud83d\udcb0 to them for service and repair. Please be aware on that. Don't buy this product \ud83d\ude4f. attached image of the part which the technician came to replace with the new one.;Uptill now since few days past, it is giving a good performance, masha'allah \ud83e\uddffSome minor bugs:1. Lenovo Vandate puts me off, it keeps asking me to reboot my laptop on every use because of some update it has downloaded.2. Also, it does get heated up soon on one side aka left side, more so while charging.3. Since the sound quality is low, I have to use a Bluetooth speaker, after which Lenovo Voice shows a bug (I am still finding out the reason)4. Hello facial recognition doesn't work because camera isn't infra-red, but fingerprint sensor works fine.Pros:1. Looks-wise it is sleek and light weighted so looks professional and easy to carry.2. Battery life 5-6 hours3. Has enough ports unlike Lenovo Yoga4. A good deal to buy a 2-in1 touchscreen laptop during sale.Perhaps I will review it again after 1 or 2 month's use.;Display quality, performance, battery life is good.;This is very good for Engineering students.Technically very nice performance, value for money, good features , very satisfied , worth buying;This is my second Lenovo laptop purchased for my son. All specifications are as per mentioned. Fast charging, sensitive touch screen and pen. Audio quality good. My son is happy n so am I;Do read all the details related to product and return process on product page. I bought this and it couldn't have been a more horrible experience for me. The item was defective. Keyboard was not working, got heated in five minutes. I tried to return the item and that is where the actual trouble began.

Despite the Amazon advertisement and label on the monitor clearly indicating that it has an inbuilt speaker, my computer settings showed \"No speaker in the system.\"After attempting to register a complaint through the Lenovo website using the provided serial number (67AEKACBINUNWOVRRR), I was unable to find any product registered under this serial number. Feeling frustrated, I reached out to Amazon for assistance.After speaking with a representative and explaining the issue, they offered a replacement for the faulty monitor. However, despite their promise to raise a complaint immediately, no action was taken. The next day, I contacted another customer care representative who promptly raised a complaint and arranged for a replacement monitor to be sent out.I am pleased to report that the new monitor arrived within two days and is in perfect working condition with functional inbuilt speakers.

The policy which this product provider has of no return and only replacement should changed immediately as he/she might be thinking that they fooled the customer and Amazon like that. But we are not fool just got trapped with the false image shown on Amazon website which never happened in the past;Overall a good purchase value for money, satisfied;While the keyboard may be a good piece of hardware, its implementation with the P12 is quite buggy at the moment. The two-finger scroll does not work well with many Google apps, but most notably with Chrome. A hack is to use your index and ring fingers instead of the index and the middle finger (as most would, naturally). I've noticed this problem with the Google Docs app as well. On the whole, I'd advise holding off on buying the P12 and its accessories until these issues are fixed.;Look and feel of the product is absolutely amazing..loved it..!!

                "text": "I chose this model with some specific requirements in mind. I am not a gamer (my gaming runs to a round of Sudoku, and that too when I get the time for it). I do not have much use for a precision stylus or so. My main uses involve reading PDF files; writing; and occasionally watching a Youtube video. So I needed a tab that was lightweight, reasonably fast, with a good screen, good storage capabilities and, most crucially, long battery life. I am happy to say this tab more than checks all my boxes.The screen resolution is excellent, more than adequate for my purposes. I prefer IPS screens to OLED; they tend to consume less battery while still yielding a decent viewing experience. The 120Hz refresh rate makes for smooth scrolling when viewing high-resolution image-based PDFs. So far the battery life has proved excellent. I tend to charge it about once in three to four days. For some reason the Amazon page does not specify SD cards of what capacity can be used. Other sites say it supports 1TB cards, which is more than ample for me (NB: I've not bought a card for it so far). The tab is also lightweight; it causes minimal discomfort even when I hold it in my hands and read or view videos in bed for extended periods. Lenovo's productivity mode deserves to be commended. Used in conjunction with opensource software like Collabora Office, it offers a decent work environment, which is all the more notable because Android was created keeping altogether different purposes in mind. But even without productivity mode, the Mac-style taskbar delivers a decent if limited office experience.UPDATE: THE P11 (2ND GEN) DOES HAVE A 3.5 MM HEADPHONE JACK!! DO NOT BE MISLED BY ERRONEOUS REVIEWS. For some reason Amazon's listed the P11 (2nd gen) and the older P11 Plus on the same page. The P11 Plus does not have a headphone jack. And the reviews and answers to questions that say there's no headphone jack were all written with the P11 Plus in mind. I REPEAT, THE P11 (2ND GEN) HAS A 3.5 MM HEADPHONE JACK, AND IT WORKS JUST FINE!!I have some grouses, though:1. Some apps don't function well in productivity mode.2. Why aren't official Lenovo keyboards, or even third-party keyboards, available anywhere on Amazon or the Lenovo India website?These shortcomings are not dealbreakers (I'm sure I'll be able to buy keyboards sooner than later). All in all, a very satisfactory deal, excellent value for money if you're not looking for high-octane gaming.;Very nice tablet under 2000 as I have bhought this under republic day sale so I got in 18000 nice tab in segment in Samsung I was getting low storage and ram so I bought this tab it has big screen also which also very good . Every thing is nice and best in this tab only one thing is  not better this tab not work in Android os it works in chrome os it is like Android and chrome mixture  . chrome os means it work like a laptop works for example the watsaapp works in laptops like that the watsaapp of this works . So it is a type of mix of laptops and mobiles I hope you understand me. This thing should be better otherwise tablet is very nice and easy to use . I bought alenvo precious pen 2 also and that alsoworks nice .;NICE PRODUCT, GOOD BATTERY BACKUP, 4G WORKS SEEMLESSLY. OVERALL VERY SATISFIED;The product I received was defective and it didn't even charge. When requested for replacement Amazon wholeheartedly pushed me down saying that they don't have power or Authority to rectify this product issues by themselves as a customer we are supposed to find the nearest service centre and resolve it by ourselves and I lost my trust after all this year's of being a Amazon which shields the manufacturer and let's the customer go through Hell who has trusted;Very nice product and tab was nice as promisedBattery life is good and good for use;As I have been using this for one year, the use is particular like reading the manual, not gaming, and I am disappointed with the product performance after one year.;Very nice;Very slow chargeing .slow opening but over all best .",

Additionally, the PAN India warranty offers peace of mind for refurbished electronics.Overall, this refurbished Lenovo ThinkCentre M93P delivers excellent performance for the price, making it a great option for users who need reliable computing power in a small form factor.;The media could not be loaded.I purchased a Lenovo Mini CPU, and it has been nothing but a disappointment. As soon as I connected it to my monitor, it displayed \u2018No Signal.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t come with an HDMI port, so I had to purchase a separate DisplayPort-to-HDMI cable, which was an unexpected hassle. Initially, I thought the cable was faulty, so I replaced it, but even with a new cable, it still didn\u2019t work. It seems the DisplayPort itself is defective.To rule out any issues with my monitor or HDMI cable, I connected my Jio setup box to the same monitor and HDMI cable, and everything worked perfectly fine. So, the problem clearly isn\u2019t with the monitor or cable. It all boils down to either the faulty DisplayPort on the CPU or the CPU itself.I also tried all possible troubleshooting steps\u2014booting without peripherals like the mouse and keyboard, turning it on and off multiple times\u2014but nothing worked. It still doesn\u2019t show anything on the monitor.Additionally, this product doesn\u2019t come with built-in Wi-Fi, so I had to purchase a separate Wi-Fi adapter. When I contacted the seller, I found out there are no returns or replacements available since the item is sold out. Lenovo support wasn\u2019t helpful either\u2014they advised me to visit a service center, where I\u2019d be charged for any repairs.This has been a frustrating experience with no resolution in sight. I strongly advise against buying this product, as you may end up with a defective item and little to no support.;Good product at a nominal price. Recommend people to go for it as it's performance is superior at very low cost.;This is a very compact and sturdy product due to the SSD drive. And due to the SSD, it is extremely fast. The installation is almost plug and play. I bought it as a second Linux box to my windows desktop for my development. My monitor had 3 inputs, of which VGA was used by my desktop. The DVI was used by the Raspberry Pi system. So the Displayport connector was used and it worked perfectly with this box. I haven't used the Windows 10 much, but tested it as a backup system. Excellent performance but the MS office installed gave warning as Not genuine and decided to not use it and deducted 1 star for that. Tested the inbuilt sound and it is decent for alert and basic music. The power adapter supplied was original and I had no issues with it.As I wanted to use Linux, I tried installing Linux over Windows 10, but the SSD was encrypted and the Linux installer could not recognize it. So I had to install it on an external SSD. That way I had both Windows and Linux option to boot. My initial Linux run were very shaky and used to hang. Later I found it to be a loose connection on the back USB and used the proper left USB port on the back. Now it is running for over a week with no hang.I got it for an excellent bargain price during the diwali sale offer. Overall an excellent buy.;Using it almost 5 months and it works really good and smooth;Looks like new. Running very fast. I like it.;Front USB ports, Mic, headphones jack not working. No wifi dongle provided! Wifi card is not installed. Ram is of Samsung brand but I doubt whether it's genuine? Ssd is of local brand. Windows installed in 2019. Though I brought this product in 2024. By default the user name is DELL though it's an refurbished Lenovo product. I think the ssd is assembled from an outdated DELL machine. It had some software issue related to OS. I replaced the ram/ssd with the better one which I had had previously. Now it's working fine (except front panel usbs and 3.5 mm sound jack) . Buy at your OWN RISK.;it worked best at starting but i am facing some issues now after 1 month , wifi keeps lossing after some time and bluetooth mouse is working properly with it",

On top of that the crappy pick up by ecomm with their agent lying about missing pick up and then you find their phone off. One of the worst experiences with amazon;I have received t480 which is like new laptop.no scratch or no defects found till now  . Battery backup is very good . Before this I returned  dell latitude 5400 which was defective. But this item satisfies in all respect. Very very goooood.thanks to amazon and seller. Cheap price great item.;The laptop arrived in excellent condition, just as they said. I was worried about getting a damaged one, but thankfully, that wasn\u2019t the case. It has an i7-8650U (not the 8550U, which they clarified which is good),intel HD 620 graphics card,16GB RAM, and a 512GB SSD. However, the display isn\u2019t 1920\u00d71080 FHD as claimed\u2014it\u2019s actually 1366\u00d7768 HD, which I expected since this model usually comes with an HD screen.Overall, it's a great laptop with some minor flaws. The keyboard has a bit of dust inside, the battery lasts around 4\u20135 hours, and there\u2019s no backlit keyboard or fingerprint sensor. If you\u2019re okay with these, it\u2019s definitely worth considering.;Worst product. Not worth the money. I used it a couple of times and multiple problems already. It suddenly switchs off and key board not working;I got a \"Like New\" Laptop with brand new compatible battery and type-c adapter that is giving backup from 6 hours to 10+ hours based on various use cases. This laptop helping me in developing pin drop silence work culture. Even if the piece I got has non working LAN port, that is not a problem at all for me, still overall performance and condition is far better than I had expected. Because there is not a single scratch to this laptop. It's like a brand new laptop. Thank you amazon and the seller.;Laptop not working;Must buy. Best under this price.;Display: page says Full HD but the seller sent me HD display which has half the resolution of Full HD and 1366x768 us not a good resolution for any display",

Super fast booting, sleek design, anti glare screen are some of the positives of this laptop. Comes with preloaded MS Office and Windows 11. Even smaller details like shutter for camera (we can actually close the camera when we aren't using the camera) have been taken care of. I absolutely love this laptop. Had one lenova laptop few years back too. Very sturdy laptops! I love this!;Display is poor.WIFI is going off all of sudden and every time we have to restart.. technical support is not able to solve the issue after 2 attempts...i would not recommend this product to anyone.;Overall, the product is quite good, but the battery drains rather quickly. Even after closing all background apps, the battery still depletes at a fast rate.;Product is good their tech support team is very cooperative and helped us in setting up the laptop.;Size very good and display is also good battery little low and processer is very fast",

Absolutely value for moneyLight weightWonderful Quality, finish & look and feelSpeed is great as per the configurationSufficiently large keys and Keyboard layout makes it very easy to useScreen size and the resolution doesn't stress the eyesVery satisfied with the product;Performance is really good.It is not proper anti-glare but screen quantity is really good.Design, weight, look and feel is really amazing.I just have an issue with battery backup, on normal use batter backupy is last long to 6-7 hrs but when you use it for video calls or Zoom/Meet/Teams session battery drains in 3-3:15 Hrs. (This is when your keyboard backlit is off)one more thing they promise that it comes with MS office and student 19 lifetime validity but provide you the trail version only.;Laptop seems good. Simple laptop with all the configurations as mentioned. Lookwise First impression is good. Office and windows are full version. It takes 15-20 seconds to boot up.Speed is OK for regular office works.Best thing 2 year warrantyThough adapter seems very delicate;could have spend 2 to 5k extra and gone with hp laptops. lenova facing issue from the day one itself. feels like cheap plastic material and keypad problem started after one month itself.. waiting to check if waranty will do something if not i will have to spend 3k for it alone.;First impressions:SpeedyGood builtGets the job done smoothlyThings which could have been better-Battery - Doesn't last more that 4hrsDisplay color - Too bright but the colors are dullCamera- low qualityPlease note this model does have lifetime MS Office Home and Student subscription. We just need to go in the app and activate the same.Will update the review after using for a few months.So far happy with the product for online teaching and planning purposes.;In the amazon it is described as this item has the backlight but the actual product was not with keyboard back light. Its a clear cheating of customer.I have requested the return of item and waiting.;It's fast , quick, keyboard is soft n touchpad no issues,sound is good,i writing this after 6 months.battery life is also good. It's updated to windows 11 n very happy with \ud83e\udd1d deal;used 1 Year and 3 months without any issue. now the power button stuck inside. When contacted the CC the supporter informing that it won't come under onsite warranty. Disappointed.",

                "text": "Posting this review after using it for nearly an year and all the screen flicker bugs have been fixed with the update and it received android 14 update recently.The software is nearly stock and is really stable now, snapdragon 695 gives adequate performance and great battery backup. The screen is also nice and great for indoor usage, 90hz refresh looks good while using. The speaker are also good for general usage, can watch movies and listen to lectures.The 5g compatibility on this device is the real USP it works great with both airtel and jio, the speeds and network stability is also good and after android 14 it supports VONR as well if you want to make calls. Using it as a 5g router works great as it gives 40-50mbps on 2.4ghz and 80-100 Mbps on 5ghz mode for the devices connected to it.All in all I'm satisfied with the purchase till now rest will update if required.;Worth for money;Value for money, display quality, performance, screen size, gaming capability and charging spee.But expect sound quality for music bit more improvement require.Overall I am satisfied and Happy.Thank you Amazon \ud83d\ude0a;I've enjoyed using it do far.  Only the sound output is low even when the volume is set to maximum.  I've raised a complaint, let's see.;Battery drains with in 6 hours... Waste product.Too heavy also;This tab comgume to much battery and it's peoformanc will excellant for few months only after that its battery praforms will normal. It's camra quality is good compair to its 18 mp camera. It's 5g it not too fast. It have only one sim slot for sim so you can keep only one sim in this tab. It heavy in weight. It have good sound quality. It will never hack. It is good for study,gameing, editing.;Pros:1. Blot apps are very low. You'll almost get a pure Android experience with very minimal Lenovo apps.2. Processor is really very fast for daily usage app. It doesn't feel that we are using mediocre SD 6 series processor. Maker did great optimisation of other hardwares of the tablet with the processor.3. Battery backup is great.4. I tested internet speed of the tablet with 5g network. It performed like premium 5g devices. Latency was too low and downloading speed was touching upto 0.9 to 1 Gbps in non peak hours (that will definately vary on location).5. Audio calls were good. No lacking in switching between 5g to volte during call.6. Split Screen was OK. Orientation sensor is working fine too.Average things:1. Both cameras are very average and basic.2. Charging technique and charger both are belonging from old gen. machines. Performs very slow.3. Display and it's brightness both are mediocre.Cons:1. Both sound outputs (inbuilt dual speaker and 3.5mm jack) are very bad. Music lover will simply hate that. You can fix only one output quality ie. You can use usb type c for audio output or bluetooth connection which will give great external sound output experience but inbuilt speaker of tablet will disappoint you alot in terms of sound quality and sound level.2. Biggest disadvantage for me is, it doesn't deliver highspeed internet (90 Mbps plus) to your other devices when you'll connect your other devices with the tablet's wifi hotspot. Although it transmits dual band frequency (5GHz and 2.4 GHz) but it is not able to give downloading speed in your other paired device more than 60 to 90 Mbps. My indication is very clear. For an example, if you're touring in a car and you're using 5g sim in this tablet so that you and your family can enjoy \"high speed internet\" on individual devices through wifi hotspot of this tablet than this won't become true ever in this tab. Even you don't have option to choose preference in btween 2.4 and 5GHz band. I have raised this issue with Lenovo service team but they are very much untrained to resolve this. They take too much time to respond and ultimately they will stop responding when they see they have left a bug in their system. I don't think any update will fix this issue. I am again repeating, it transmits 5Ghz bandwidth frequency (when you use hotspot of the tablet) but doesn't deliver high speed data to any of your wifi5 or wifi6 enabled device. If you'll connect 3 devices than every connected device will get downloading speed below the HSPA network, forget about 4g speed in those devices.Verdict:For basic study: 4.5/5For elder members of family (who doesn't have hearing issues) : 4/5For music lover: 0/5 (if using external speakers), 2/5 (if you're using aux based headphones), 5/5 (if you're using high quality usb-c to aux converter or bluetooth headphones, speakers etc.)For multimedia content (in terms of display only): 3/5Internet Speed on this device while using with wifi/5g connection: 5/5Internet speed on other connected device(s) with this tablet's 5g sim: 1.5/5Battery 4.5/5Gps: 5/5Calling and messaging: 4.5/5Processor performance (when comparing this to other SD695 and 8GB RAM based devices): 5/5Conclusion: one who is looking for 5g enabled budget tablet, I will say please wait for few more months (if you're not in hurry) because as of now, no budget 5g tablet are giving expected outcomes.;Being VERY hard on tech objects, phones, pads and laptops ..this Lenovo tablet was an amazing discovery. I used the same model 4g for 3.5 years, it has been dropped banged and is normally on 24/7 playing the radio through the night. The only issue now is that the display is going, this can be repaired but I chose to upgrade to the same machine in 5g.NOONE could be disappointed worth twice the price!",

                "text": "Thanks to amazon for giving massive discount on my sbi card during republic day sale which made it possible for me to get this beast. It performs as you think it would.Everything runs buttery smooth but there is battery drop issue i think 230w adapter will fix that aside from that there is not problem and rgb backlight keyboard would have been cool.;So the best thing about this laptop is that the build quality is sturdy. Do note that this processor has no iGPU so your battery life is limited to 4 hours and does not go higher than that when not plugged in. That being said a friend of mine got the G14 zyphrus and we were gaming at max settings and this laptop did not hit 60 degrees whereas the G14 was touching 85 degrees hence the cooling system is amazing. Another thing I have realised is that I don\u2019t use the laptop when it isn\u2019t plugged in and I do not require 15 -20 hrs of battery life. Also all tasks and jobs run very smoothly on this and I feel its worth the trade off for price and hardware;Got it at 71k, faced a screen flickering issue after 2 days but other than that it worths every single penny in terms of display and gaming. It has better display and gaming performance then nitro and victus.;As people have mentioned previously, the main issue is due to unavailablity of iGPU which spoils the battery life. Overall a decent laptop and worth the price.I\u2019ll edit my comms after using it for a couple of months;This lap when fully charged shuts down in just one hour even with usage without the internet. I bought this gaming laptop expecting it's efficiency. But never expected such a low quality battery in such a new age laptop. What is the use of any technology if you can't use it. Imagine you buy a phone with all the latest technology from the top brand but battery dies  in qn 1 hour, will you buy? Even if it's given for free you won't use it. I wonder why companies even make such useless laptops. Horrible experience from Lenovo, never expected. I feel cheated and and have lost 80,000 I paid for this.;So far i am really satisfied with my Laptop. Yes there are some things that could have been better. Like the brightness could have been better. But the colour accuracy and all is good. The build is noce. Speaker quality is good not so bad but could have been better. It is on a heavier side but you know it is a gaming laptop. Many people complaint about the fan noise but i think most of the gaming laptops have this thing. It is just to keep your machine cool you can ignore that. The fan speed can be kept in quiet mode in normal usage. Battery life if you ask me lasted for 2.5-3hrs but i saw a minor charge drop while i was using heavily. 170w charger is not enough. J suggest you contact the customer care and get a 230w one. I bought it for \u20b969k during republic day sale. I think its worth every penny.;Everything is very good but battery is equally bad;After all settings down and in igpu mode and 60hz it around 4 hours itz pretty good but not sufficient for students i think \ud83e\udd14 70 wh ki battery deni chahiye inko",

                "text": ";its a good budget friendly setup but the one i received had dysfunctional hard drive. it just wont be able to boot windows. so i removed the hard drive and connected it as external via usb. the drive wasn't detected in windows or ubuntu. it was a total disaster. i had a spare ssd that i plugged in and using it as internal drive now. installed OS after lots of trouble as well. had several tpm related issues. remember secure boot is not available in this setup or im missing something but I don't know for sure, i tried lot many things to enable secure boot but just couldn't find the option for it in BIOS. virtualization is not supported by i5 2nd gen so, you don't get that either. overall, performance is average and can be managed for office tasks.it has 128 MB VRAM. just enough for basic animations.;it was a good deal, worked well;Its been 2weeks I've been using it and it shows no faulty issue except fan sound is little weird but it's okay...speed is also good.. \ud83d\udc4d thank you Amazon..;Purchased this renewed Lenovo M92p for 10,000/- and for the price it's okay.Talking about Desktop Hardware, Specifically, system specs are\u2022  Intel i5-2400 a 2nd gen processor\u2022  8GB DDR3 1333Mhz RAM\u2022  Lenovo OEM motherboard\u2022 Seagate 500GB 7200RPM Hard Disk\u2022 Windows 10 lifetime\u2022 MS Office lifetime\u2022 USB WiFi AdapterIn the amazon box, you get a CPU and power cable. The CPU is not well packaged, which concerned me about the damage but luckily it is in good condition. And yes as this is a renewed product it has some scratches on the cabinet.For the first-time startup, it took around 5 min because of the OS installed on the Hard Disk. Even after starting up disk usage was 100% causing lag to do other tasks. After about 30-45 min every thing settled and on I did some testing and benchmarks.For the confirmation/verification of the advertised specs, I open the system properties and BIOS & everything was OK, the specs are the same. But the real problem here is all the hardware- processor motherboard, HDD, DVD is in used condition and has a manufacturing date of 2011. After doing some tests I found that my system was already used for 811 days (screenshot attached). So I decided to ask for a replacement(within 24 hours), but then what, I cant find an option for nor return either replacement which we generally find in any regular orders. The only option I was getting is to \u201c Get product support\u201d which provides a contact number of the seller. I tried that number several times but it just keep on ringing.Final conclusion for this kind of renewed product is \u201cChala to chand tak warna raat tak\u201d Will update the review if find any new information to share.;Value for money.;The product got damaged within 15 days, when the service center was contacted, they told me to courier the product to Delhi, the customer will have to pay the courier charges of Rs 1500, so please do not buy this product;Superb",

                "text": "The media could not be loaded.The Lenovo 300 FHD WebCam with stereo dual built in mics is a fantastic addition to any set up for video calls, streaming or recording. with FHD 1080P 2.1 megapixel CMOS camera, This WebCam delivers crystal clear images and videos with great detail and vibrant colours.One of the standout features of this WebCam is its ultra wide 95\u00b0 lens, which ensure that you can fit more into the frame and not miss out on any action. The digital zoom feature allows you to zoom in on specific details without losing quality. while the 360\u00b0 rotation gives you the flexibility to adjust the angle to your likingThe built-in stereo dual mics provide clear and crisp audio, perfect for both voice calls and recordings. Whether you are on a conference call or streaming your favourite games, The sound quality from the Mics is impressive.The flexible mount makes it easy to attach the webcam to your laptop, monitor or tripod security. The cloud grey colour gives it a slick and modern Look that will complement any set up.With its excellent camera quality, wide angle lens, dual mics and flexible mounting options, This WebCam is assure to enhance your video experience. Overall product is worth adding to your gadgets bag.;The quality of the webcam is great and the microphone is also very sensitive and can pickup even the slightest sound. The camera is wide angle and gives a large field of view. The only con is that the camera doesn't have auto focus. The usage of this webcam is very easy as it is simply plug & play. The price of the webcam is also value for money.;Good cam a bit wide angle so think before buying as its literally wide and can't be adjusted as such. Over all a good quality but the closing lid can lead to scratches so don't use that too much I suggest to disconnect when not in use rather than using the lid as obviously it's a bit tight and leads to small scratches by time. But if yours is loose a bit then you are good to go. Mine is a bit tight so I just disconnect the USB by which the life is also extended I guess so as it won't draw any power;The range of area of the webcam is very good, but the main issue is that it's exposure is very low which darken the video very much. If not for studio lights, the face and other shadowing areas becomes very dark. Not satisfied with this lack of brightness;This is the best 1080p camera you can get in this price point. Specially if you get it in a offer price with a 500-600 discount.The low light performance is not awesome but it is not bad either. But if you have proper light against you the quality of the video improves significantly.;Bad picture quality, the camera stopped working after 3 months. Tried contacting to the brand support, but it was impossible to get to get them.;You cannot get a well lit environment everytime for video calls. So this webcam might not always be suitable for video conferencing, because it does not adapt well with low light. But in decebt light, the focus is incredible, video quality is amazing, and even video stabilization is decent. And connectivity is instant as well.;I recently purchased the Lenovo 300 FHD Webcam, and I must say that I'm thoroughly impressed with its performance. As someone who relies on video conferencing for work and keeping in touch with friends and family, this webcam has truly elevated my virtual communication experience.The FHD 1080P 2.1 Megapixel CMOS camera provides exceptional video quality. The image is sharp and clear, and the colors are vibrant, making it perfect for video calls, streaming, or even recording videos. The ultra-wide 95-degree lens ensures that I can capture everything in the frame, whether I'm in a small meeting room or a larger space. The ability to digitally zoom in allows for even more flexibility, and the 360-degree rotation feature is incredibly handy when I need to switch between different views.One of the standout features of this webcam is the dual built-in microphones. The full stereo audio is a game-changer for my virtual meetings. The sound is crisp, and it really feels like I'm in the same room as my colleagues. It eliminates the need for an external microphone, which is a fantastic convenience. Plus, it reduces background noise effectively, ensuring that my voice is always the center of attention.Setup was a breeze, and the webcam's compatibility with various operating systems made it even more versatile. Whether I'm using Windows, macOS, or Linux, it works seamlessly without any hiccups. The USB plug-and-play design means I didn't need to install any additional drivers \u2013 it was truly a plug-and-play experience.The build quality of the Lenovo 300 FHD Webcam feels robust and durable. It's designed to sit securely on top of my monitor or laptop, and the adjustable clip ensures a snug fit. I also appreciate the privacy cover that slides over the lens when not in use, adding an extra layer of security.In summary, the Lenovo 300 FHD Webcam is a fantastic addition to my digital toolkit. Its exceptional video quality, full stereo audio, and versatile features have made it a must-have for anyone who relies on video conferencing or content creation. It's a great value for the price, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. If you're in the market for a high-quality webcam, I highly recommend giving this one a try. You won't be disappointed!;This camera is perfect for joining Microsoft Teams meetings. The video & microphone quality is great and simple, just plug and play.;Good enough. Clear picture. Works better with a lot of lighting.;Es una c\u00e1mara con una muy buena y bonita resoluci\u00f3n. Es f\u00e1cil de usar, sin tantas complicaciones. La recomiendo mucho porque es de buena calidad y presentaci\u00f3n.;O que chama a aten\u00e7\u00e3o logo de cara, \u00e9 a angula\u00e7\u00e3o aberta. Ela capta at\u00e9 o que voc\u00ea tem certeza que n\u00e3o vai aparecer. Aparece. Em segundo lugar, a qualidade. A webcam do meu notebook \u00e9 inferior \u00e0s webcams da d\u00e9cada de 90. A mudan\u00e7a \u00e9 radical. A qualidade desse c\u00e2mera \u00e9 fenomenal. Vi muitos reviews na web falando mal do autofoco, do equil\u00edbrio de brancos, e outras coisas. Fica meu conselho, esses reviews s\u00e3o muito exigentes, portanto se depender deles, voc\u00ea n\u00e3o compra a webcam.Como ponto cr\u00edtico dos reviews, o fato da angula\u00e7\u00e3o ser muito aberta, pode comprometer a privacidade de quem a utiliza. Minha recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o, \u00e9 fazer o uso de aplicativos de captura de imagem. Por exemplo, eu utilizo um software gratuito de tr\u00eas letras, voltado para captura de tela, de webcam e outras coisas. Nele configuro essa webcam para cortar o \u00e2ngulo aberto e deixar fechado apenas no meu rosto.Pois essa webcam n\u00e3o possui ajuste de corte. Ou voc\u00ea utiliza o fundo desfocado se dispon\u00edvel na aplica\u00e7\u00e3o.De resto, ela vem com um cabo suficiente longo, para quem utilizar em computador desktop, protetor de privacidade para fechar a c\u00e2mera (eu prefiro desplugar o USB do note, quando a n\u00e3o utilizo), possui dois leds bem discretos (branco para informar que est\u00e1 recebendo energia e verde, quando est\u00e1 sendo utilizada), na base possui uma esp\u00e9cie de garra, que se prende a qualquer superf\u00edcie sem danificar, possui prote\u00e7\u00e3o na garra e a webcam gira em 360 graus, possui encaixe para trip\u00e9 (uso padr\u00e3o) e possui ajuste de altura, limitado por\u00e9m suficiente.A melhor c\u00e2mera que voc\u00ea pode comprar, em termos de custo e benef\u00edcio.Microfone est\u00e9reo dela n\u00e3o utilizei, utilizo mais fones de ouvido bluetooth. Ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o sei precisar a qualidade.Se voc\u00ea \u00e9 um usu\u00e1rio leigo, e o fato dela ser muito expositiva (em termos de abertura angular), o ideal \u00e9 procurar uma webcam com o \u00e2ngulo mais fechado, como as de entrada. Agora, se isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 um problema, essa webcam \u00e9 pra voc\u00ea.;Good basic camera, lenses cover is a plus",

I really like the way the laptop is designed slim and compact. And it\u2019s performance is perfect for my day to day use. Moreover the screen is so good to watch my favourite shows and YouTube videos.The slim and compact design of the laptop helps me carry it around almost anywhere with hassle. I\u2019ve also used it for light gaming!!!! SUPER HAPPY to have the Idea pad Slim 5 and excited to be part of the Lenovo family.Looks 5 out of 5Experience 5 out of 5Light Gaming 4 out of 5Budget friendly 5 out of 5;1. You don't get one year warranty with the laptop as it is mentioned with the item. But Amazon from its end nominally give you a warranty for one year which won't be reflected in Lenovo Vantage. In order to get your justiciable warranty, you need to struggle a lot with Lenovo. They will ask you 1000 and 100 proofs. If you are not concerned about warranty then you can buy this laptop.2. This laptop doesn't support Alexa. I tried but I failed. Finally I found that this laptop is not compatible with Alexa.3. There are many 2024 year manufactured laptops are there. Buy a good one. If you still want this 2023 August manufacture model, then go ahead and buy. It can be a good museum piece in your home.4. Finally it is your choice to buy headache and tension or a good advanced model of some other company.;Good laptop, great performance;Value for money;I got this laptop for everyday use and light office applications like PowerPoint and Excel. It\u2019s super lightweight and I can carry it anywhere I need to without hurting my shoulders.Pros:LightweightGreat ScreenNo lag when using most applicationsCons:Can\u2019t really play any games on it. But have a gaming system for those needs.;Not a good laptop, I facing heating issues without do anything;Worth buying \ud83d\udc4c;The media could not be loaded.Pathetic damaged product delivered with display issue and it is very hard to get support from Amazon. Another example of scam during sale days, hope I will get my money back and i prefer to go to brand directly to get what I want",

                "text": "Posting this review after using it for nearly an year and all the screen flicker bugs have been fixed with the update and it received android 14 update recently.The software is nearly stock and is really stable now, snapdragon 695 gives adequate performance and great battery backup. The screen is also nice and great for indoor usage, 90hz refresh looks good while using. The speaker are also good for general usage, can watch movies and listen to lectures.The 5g compatibility on this device is the real USP it works great with both airtel and jio, the speeds and network stability is also good and after android 14 it supports VONR as well if you want to make calls. Using it as a 5g router works great as it gives 40-50mbps on 2.4ghz and 80-100 Mbps on 5ghz mode for the devices connected to it.All in all I'm satisfied with the purchase till now rest will update if required.;Worth for money;Value for money, display quality, performance, screen size, gaming capability and charging spee.But expect sound quality for music bit more improvement require.Overall I am satisfied and Happy.Thank you Amazon \ud83d\ude0a;I've enjoyed using it do far.  Only the sound output is low even when the volume is set to maximum.  I've raised a complaint, let's see.;Battery drains with in 6 hours... Waste product.Too heavy also;This tab comgume to much battery and it's peoformanc will excellant for few months only after that its battery praforms will normal. It's camra quality is good compair to its 18 mp camera. It's 5g it not too fast. It have only one sim slot for sim so you can keep only one sim in this tab. It heavy in weight. It have good sound quality. It will never hack. It is good for study,gameing, editing.;Pros:1. Blot apps are very low. You'll almost get a pure Android experience with very minimal Lenovo apps.2. Processor is really very fast for daily usage app. It doesn't feel that we are using mediocre SD 6 series processor. Maker did great optimisation of other hardwares of the tablet with the processor.3. Battery backup is great.4. I tested internet speed of the tablet with 5g network. It performed like premium 5g devices. Latency was too low and downloading speed was touching upto 0.9 to 1 Gbps in non peak hours (that will definately vary on location).5. Audio calls were good. No lacking in switching between 5g to volte during call.6. Split Screen was OK. Orientation sensor is working fine too.Average things:1. Both cameras are very average and basic.2. Charging technique and charger both are belonging from old gen. machines. Performs very slow.3. Display and it's brightness both are mediocre.Cons:1. Both sound outputs (inbuilt dual speaker and 3.5mm jack) are very bad. Music lover will simply hate that. You can fix only one output quality ie. You can use usb type c for audio output or bluetooth connection which will give great external sound output experience but inbuilt speaker of tablet will disappoint you alot in terms of sound quality and sound level.2. Biggest disadvantage for me is, it doesn't deliver highspeed internet (90 Mbps plus) to your other devices when you'll connect your other devices with the tablet's wifi hotspot. Although it transmits dual band frequency (5GHz and 2.4 GHz) but it is not able to give downloading speed in your other paired device more than 60 to 90 Mbps. My indication is very clear. For an example, if you're touring in a car and you're using 5g sim in this tablet so that you and your family can enjoy \"high speed internet\" on individual devices through wifi hotspot of this tablet than this won't become true ever in this tab. Even you don't have option to choose preference in btween 2.4 and 5GHz band. I have raised this issue with Lenovo service team but they are very much untrained to resolve this. They take too much time to respond and ultimately they will stop responding when they see they have left a bug in their system. I don't think any update will fix this issue. I am again repeating, it transmits 5Ghz bandwidth frequency (when you use hotspot of the tablet) but doesn't deliver high speed data to any of your wifi5 or wifi6 enabled device. If you'll connect 3 devices than every connected device will get downloading speed below the HSPA network, forget about 4g speed in those devices.Verdict:For basic study: 4.5/5For elder members of family (who doesn't have hearing issues) : 4/5For music lover: 0/5 (if using external speakers), 2/5 (if you're using aux based headphones), 5/5 (if you're using high quality usb-c to aux converter or bluetooth headphones, speakers etc.)For multimedia content (in terms of display only): 3/5Internet Speed on this device while using with wifi/5g connection: 5/5Internet speed on other connected device(s) with this tablet's 5g sim: 1.5/5Battery 4.5/5Gps: 5/5Calling and messaging: 4.5/5Processor performance (when comparing this to other SD695 and 8GB RAM based devices): 5/5Conclusion: one who is looking for 5g enabled budget tablet, I will say please wait for few more months (if you're not in hurry) because as of now, no budget 5g tablet are giving expected outcomes.;Being VERY hard on tech objects, phones, pads and laptops ..this Lenovo tablet was an amazing discovery. I used the same model 4g for 3.5 years, it has been dropped banged and is normally on 24/7 playing the radio through the night. The only issue now is that the display is going, this can be repaired but I chose to upgrade to the same machine in 5g.NOONE could be disappointed worth twice the price!",

(This is when your keyboard backlit is off)one more thing they promise that it comes with MS office and student 19 lifetime validity but provide you the trail version only.;Laptop seems good. Simple laptop with all the configurations as mentioned. Lookwise First impression is good. Office and windows are full version. It takes 15-20 seconds to boot up.Speed is OK for regular office works.Best thing 2 year warrantyThough adapter seems very delicate;could have spend 2 to 5k extra and gone with hp laptops. lenova facing issue from the day one itself. feels like cheap plastic material and keypad problem started after one month itself.. waiting to check if waranty will do something if not i will have to spend 3k for it alone.;First impressions:SpeedyGood builtGets the job done smoothlyThings which could have been better-Battery - Doesn't last more that 4hrsDisplay color - Too bright but the colors are dullCamera- low qualityPlease note this model does have lifetime MS Office Home and Student subscription. We just need to go in the app and activate the same.Will update the review after using for a few months.So far happy with the product for online teaching and planning purposes.;In the amazon it is described as this item has the backlight but the actual product was not with keyboard back light. Its a clear cheating of customer.I have requested the return of item and waiting.;It's fast , quick, keyboard is soft n touchpad no issues,sound is good,i writing this after 6 months.battery life is also good. It's updated to windows 11 n very happy with \ud83e\udd1d deal;used 1 Year and 3 months without any issue. now the power button stuck inside. When contacted the CC the supporter informing that it won't come under onsite warranty. Disappointed.",

                "text": "I chose this model with some specific requirements in mind. I am not a gamer (my gaming runs to a round of Sudoku, and that too when I get the time for it). I do not have much use for a precision stylus or so. My main uses involve reading PDF files; writing; and occasionally watching a Youtube video. So I needed a tab that was lightweight, reasonably fast, with a good screen, good storage capabilities and, most crucially, long battery life. I am happy to say this tab more than checks all my boxes.The screen resolution is excellent, more than adequate for my purposes. I prefer IPS screens to OLED; they tend to consume less battery while still yielding a decent viewing experience. The 120Hz refresh rate makes for smooth scrolling when viewing high-resolution image-based PDFs. So far the battery life has proved excellent. I tend to charge it about once in three to four days. For some reason the Amazon page does not specify SD cards of what capacity can be used. Other sites say it supports 1TB cards, which is more than ample for me (NB: I've not bought a card for it so far). The tab is also lightweight; it causes minimal discomfort even when I hold it in my hands and read or view videos in bed for extended periods. Lenovo's productivity mode deserves to be commended. Used in conjunction with opensource software like Collabora Office, it offers a decent work environment, which is all the more notable because Android was created keeping altogether different purposes in mind. But even without productivity mode, the Mac-style taskbar delivers a decent if limited office experience.UPDATE: THE P11 (2ND GEN) DOES HAVE A 3.5 MM HEADPHONE JACK!! DO NOT BE MISLED BY ERRONEOUS REVIEWS. For some reason Amazon's listed the P11 (2nd gen) and the older P11 Plus on the same page. The P11 Plus does not have a headphone jack. And the reviews and answers to questions that say there's no headphone jack were all written with the P11 Plus in mind. I REPEAT, THE P11 (2ND GEN) HAS A 3.5 MM HEADPHONE JACK, AND IT WORKS JUST FINE!!I have some grouses, though:1. Some apps don't function well in productivity mode.2. Why aren't official Lenovo keyboards, or even third-party keyboards, available anywhere on Amazon or the Lenovo India website?These shortcomings are not dealbreakers (I'm sure I'll be able to buy keyboards sooner than later). All in all, a very satisfactory deal, excellent value for money if you're not looking for high-octane gaming.;Very nice tablet under 2000 as I have bhought this under republic day sale so I got in 18000 nice tab in segment in Samsung I was getting low storage and ram so I bought this tab it has big screen also which also very good . Every thing is nice and best in this tab only one thing is  not better this tab not work in Android os it works in chrome os it is like Android and chrome mixture  . chrome os means it work like a laptop works for example the watsaapp works in laptops like that the watsaapp of this works . So it is a type of mix of laptops and mobiles I hope you understand me. This thing should be better otherwise tablet is very nice and easy to use . I bought alenvo precious pen 2 also and that alsoworks nice .;NICE PRODUCT, GOOD BATTERY BACKUP, 4G WORKS SEEMLESSLY. OVERALL VERY SATISFIED;The product I received was defective and it didn't even charge. When requested for replacement Amazon wholeheartedly pushed me down saying that they don't have power or Authority to rectify this product issues by themselves as a customer we are supposed to find the nearest service centre and resolve it by ourselves and I lost my trust after all this year's of being a Amazon which shields the manufacturer and let's the customer go through Hell who has trusted;Very nice product and tab was nice as promisedBattery life is good and good for use;As I have been using this for one year, the use is particular like reading the manual, not gaming, and I am disappointed with the product performance after one year.;Very nice;Very slow chargeing .slow opening but over all best .",

                "text": "Definitely worth the purchase! Performance is perfect, build quality's the best I've seen on any laptop I've ever owned, doesn't heat up much even while gaming, size is just perfect too since it's almost as easy as carrying a tablet.. in love with the speakers too, which aren't that loud for outdoor usage but perfect crisp sound for streaming and calls.. windows works well, and Linux runs on steroids.. tried and tested Linux Mint, Pop_OS, MX Linux, Endeavour OS, Garuda Linux and Ubuntu (yup, I hate it the most, but still installed it for OCD's sake ;) ).. they ran smooth without any issues at all! The only con I hope gets sorted soon are the Goodix drivers for the fingerprint sensors on the Lenovo Thinkpad E14 Gen 5 are proprietary and not recognized out of the box on Linux. That being said, It's a beast worth buying, the upgradability is phenomenal!;Build Quality: 10/10Very good solid build, Metal top lid and sturdy base. Overall size reduced as compared to previous Gen ThinkPad 14inch models. Less weight.Display: 6/10WUXGA is not convenient for streaming videos as the width reduced by 1cm and height increased, maybe good for programming. FHD IPS is always better with wide screen. Also in the name of reducing blue light, they made the display colour profile little warm in this new WUXGA display.Performance: 8/10Decent performance for Ryzen 5 with 16GB RAM. Performance is good than HP ProBook with i5 12th gen.Keyboard: 7/10The new chicklet type keyboard with smaller keys and key spacing is not so convenient. ThinkPad fans would get disappointed for this new keyboard. Trackpad is good.Battery: 7/10 Heavy usage lasts for 2-3 hrs and Light usage lasts for 5-8 hrs.Overall, it's the config package is very good except WUXGA resolution and keyboard.;Edit after 1 year: It started having a weird problem where it's not turning on sometimes. Warranty expired just one month ago. Diagnostic test is showing no problem. Took to two different service centre but to no avail. Regretting buying from Amazon.The laptop is great to use. It's lightweight and that is one of its perks for me being a college student.Performance is good. I have played GTA V on low settings and FIFA 19.Battery is what you would expect. If you keep it on \"Best power efficiency\" and use it for normal office work then it will give you 8 hours of usage. Although this will reduce with time.One thing I dislike about it is that it's a fingerprint magnet. So now I'm looking for a cleaning kit! But other than that I'm happy with my purchase provided it runs fine for a few years.;One of the best built windows laptop. Got a great deal during independence day sale.Review after 1 month of use:Processor:-Ryzen 7530U is a best processor clubbed with 16GB RAM is very good for programming or running heavy applications.Keyboard:-I am not quite happy with the new keyboard in Gen 5 as compared to older gen. Lenovo says its more tactile but i feel it moved more towards chicket one which is not what a thinkpad user likes.Webcam:- Webcam could have been better. If there is a even a small light source opp. to the camera, images get very blur. In proper lighting it ok to use, but better to have a seperate webcam if your work requires frequent calls.Battery:- Battery backup is good for a window laptop. With Balanced setting it can easily last for 6-7 hours. Company claims 12 hrs which i feel is not possible and just a gimmick.Display:- Anti Glare screen is just amazing. you will love this if you are a developer and casual OTT consumer. However this is a IPS panel which i feel is the biggest upgrade from older gen thinkpads at this price range, but max brightness is slightly on the lower side of 250 nits. I may be feeling this slightly more i as i used Macbook Air M1 which has around 400 nits with retina display. Since this being built for professional use, i wouldn't recommend this for graphic designing or photoshop due to low colour accuracy  in the displayPorts:Having 2 USB Type C port in Gen 5 is a great plus. You get 2 high speed type a as well. Having Lan and HDMI port is a great relief compared to my MacWin 11 & Office:Both comes pre installed and best part pre activated, you just need to link you office got and done.Overall a great laptop for developers and normal OTT consumer. Value for money product with military grade design.;Ryzen 5 7530U is enough for routine tasks.It is Lightweight and can be carried easily.You are going to like the black colour.Display is wuxga 300 nits and it is better than most laptops available in this price range.Sound is not that loud since it's a business laptop but during movies u won't feel that much lag as the sound quality is great.Battery Life is better than all the laptops I have used till date.;I am writing this review after using it from last 20 days.It's good, working smoothly \ud83d\udcaf;When it is clearly mentioned in the Amazon product details that''Operating System: Preloaded Windows 11 Home SL with Lifetime Validity",

Pls note this bag is most suitable for light weight new generation laptops and not useful for heavier model laptops.This bag has sufficient storage space and very easy to carry. Don't think twice just go for it. It's really a worthful buy and completely satisfied with the product.;I recently acquired the Lenovo 15.6-inch Casual Laptop Briefcase from Amazon, and it's proven to be a great addition for carrying my laptop and essential accessories. The design is sleek and modern, making it suitable for both professional and casual use. The multiple compartments provide ample storage and organization options for my laptop, charger, documents, and more.The build quality is commendable, with durable materials that offer good protection for my laptop. The padding inside adds an extra layer of safety. The adjustable straps make it comfortable to carry, and the handles are well-padded for a firm grip.My only minor concern is that it could have more padding at the bottom to provide enhanced protection against accidental drops or bumps. Nonetheless, it has met my expectations and proved its worth in terms of convenience and style. Overall, the Lenovo 15.6-inch Casual Laptop Briefcase is a reliable choice for anyone seeking a functional and stylish laptop bag.;Using regularly since bought. Good fabric and spacious.;The product dimensions are absolutely perfect for 15.6-inch laptops to fit in. You can easily carry your laptop charger phone and some small things. But the storage space is average not very good because you cannot store many things and the belt feels a little cheap like there is always a fear of it breaking.;No Good But Ok Product;good;Bag quality is good.;Really good quality stuff. Very spacious, very smart. Waterproof. Excellent looking. Bought it as a gift may buy again for myself too. Only drawback, there was no Amazon packaging. Just packed in a clear packet and all receipt and bar codes just stuck on it like stickers.;A cor \u00e9 bem bonita, parece um jeans, os z\u00edperes deslizam suavemente, sem se agarrarem, as al\u00e7as de boa qualidade e o interior acolchoado, al\u00e9m de ter um \u00f3timo tamanho. Super recomendo!;I\u2019m absolutely thrilled with this laptop bag! It\u2019s impressively light yet robust, with a durable build that feels like it will hold up to daily use. The blue color is spot-on to what\u2019s shown in the pictures - vibrant and stylish. The zippers glide effortlessly, adding to the overall ease of use. The spacious design is a game-changer, offering ample room for my 15.6-inch laptop, tablet, and all my essential work items. Whether for work, school, or casual outings, it fits everything perfectly without feeling bulky. For under $20, it\u2019s an unbeatable deal! I\u2019m already planning to grab the other colors available. Already bought two more to gift to family. Absolutely love it - highly recommend!;I ordered this Lenovo carrying case T210 for my 15 Inch Laptop. I rarely take my laptop out of the house but wanted to have an inexpensive case with a shoulder strap for the times that I do. I actually ordered another one online but when it arrived with a shoulder strap there was literally no where to attach the strap. After this experience I paid closer attention to other carrying cases and it seems it was not an isolated problem, particularly with the more affordable options. I was of course delighted to find this product and ordered it. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time. It\u2019s the size as advertised and fits my laptop well. It has compartments inside and a zippered pouch on one of the exterior sides. Shoulder strap works well. The Heather dark gray fabric on the outside is quite appealing in my opinion and I do like that the inside liner is not black as the usual black makes it more difficult to find items inside. The nylon turquoise liner inside this bag seems good.All indications are that it will be suitable for my purposes. I am pleased with my $22 purchase.;Excelente producto llego a tiempo de muy buena calidad justo lo que ped\u00ed y en un precio que ufff;This is a great laptop bag. The storage is ample, and yet it is not bulky. The zippers open and close well and the front pouch has a nice concealed zipper to deter thefts. The padding is good. The material has a sleek and stylish look. Great value in this laptop bag compared to others which are similarly priced.",

                "text": "I bought this laptop last month, after using the machine for over a month here my observationsDecent battery backup, display is nice, best for heavy browsing and simple working like excel, word, Power point etc. so far haven't faced any issues with the laptop. Navigation within the application is smooth, haven't observed any heating issues.I received a really good product as no visible damages, if you look closely you can figure it out it's used or refurbished laptop.Overall happy with the purchase.The seller is also very supportive and helping. I wanted to register my warranty reached out to them over whatsapp they guided me with the steps for registration and seeked timely feedback.Best for low budget purchase and for basic usage.;Amazon stated that the product is eligible for replacement. However, on the day I received the product, I informed Amazon that the charger was not working. I expected a replacement, but they said a replacement wasn\u2019t possible, and I would need to return the product instead. I placed a return request on the same day, but it has been over 10 days, and the order still hasn\u2019t been picked up. This delay has left me unable to use the laptop or purchase a new one, as I\u2019m waiting for the refund. Consequently, my work has been significantly delayed.;Received the product as described. packing was excellent.. Seller provides their own secure packing apart from Amazons packing. Product received in excellent condition.. Could barely find any scratches.. Windows 11 and Ms office pre installed. Quality and performance of laptop is as good as new laptop. Seller is highly approachable n good customer support from seller edify winuall.;I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but within just two months, the SSD failed completely, rendering the device unusable. To make matters worse, Windows crashed repeatedly before the failure, making it impossible to work efficiently.When I reached out to the seller for support, I was met with nothing but excuses. They refused to arrange collection or offer a proper replacement, leaving me stuck with a faulty product and no resolution. For the price I paid, I expected at least a functional device and decent customer service. Instead, I got neither.Avoid this seller and their defective products at all costs. If something goes wrong, don\u2019t expect any help!;I'm really pleased with this laptop! It has a sleek design, excellent build quality, and the performance is impressive.The keyboard feels comfortable to type on, and it\u2019s fast and responsive, handling multitasking with ease. Overall, it\u2019s a great value for the features and performance it offers!;The laptop arrived on time and was well-packaged.It configured as advertised, with good performance for a refurbished device.The exterior condition is good;  nothing unexpected for a refurbished item.The performance is also as expected.After 4 months of use , got issue of HDD detection , but as the laptop is within warranty , seller taken care of the issues and  resolved within 4/5 daysThe sellers was well behaved too and understandable .;The media could not be loaded.I bought this product for my work. Because of my urgency I paid extra money for fast delivery and I got the product by 10pm. At 11pm this blue screen was showing and it will show its restarting but it won't restart. I waited more than 3 hour for the restart. But I had to manually shut it down and again logged in. After that every 1 hour it's behaving the same. Showing blue screen, restarting, shutting down, logging in. So I contacted the seller and went to the sellers place and they found out it was RAM issue and they changed it. After that I came back to my place and trying to log in it'll login but automatically shutdown within seconds. For this issue I spend 400rs for travelling and wasted my time as well. Now I am returning the product since they have no replacement.This is my experience but not all products are same. If you want you can buy or not.The sellers was well behaved and tried to sort the issue. But it didn't work.;Rarely used sofar. No problem came after 6 months of usage.Please consider to buy this. Good battery back up",

So yeah again normal-normal.Hardware is top notch, the keyboard quality is good.So all in all it is very good laptop, it will get all your normal needs done, go for it ,you will get it in 45k in sale.;Light weight easy to carry, good processor for day to day office work with home 11 and Ms office pre installed. Screen brightness is decent indoor but speaker is pathetic so not recommended for multimedia use case. If you want a laptop for office work with low budget below 50k go for it. I got it for 39k with bank office in great Indian sales and satisfied with it.;The product I received has issues with both hardware and software. The hardware is not functioning properly, and the software is also problematic. Additionally, the system is not working smoothly as expected. Please address these issues and provide a solution at the earliest.;battery drains fast runs only for 3.5 hrperformance is good but after 6-7 hrs of continuous use for study starts to lag and does not loadbuy for 32k through credit card and exchange offerotherwise don't  buy;After using it for a day -Display : pretty goodSpeakers - Below averageBattery life - GoodCamera - GoodPerformed well in dead pixel and keyboard functionality test.Overall amazing laptop for the price .....;Does my job without any hiccups. Happy with the purchase.;Quality and functionality is smooth.Seems best product and got it for 40k during the sale.Battery life is good.Camera quality and sound is just Ok.",

Size and weight is not too much. All together it is value for money.;The media could not be loaded.Using it for a month and a halfPros:16gb ram is a wise choice for a coder.Screen Quality is good (Don't know why there were a lot of negative reviews about it), Genuine Windows 11 and MS office (great for students and content creators),Lightweight, easy and fast.Drawbacks:audio could have been better ( I use earphones and speaker so not an issue for me).definitely not a gaming laptop even if it advertises as such (xbox 3 month pass and I couldn't use it because video memory is lower than my previous lap)no backlit keyboard (it's not available in any IdeaPad slim 1)the metal body easily gets scratched and chipped (my advise is buy laptop bag or skin immediately, even a week is too late)Comment: first time ryzen user and gotta say it's good for everything outside gaming. Students and soft computer users can definitely go for this. If you're a gamer I would advise i5 and something with a graphic card. 16gb ram is better if you use a lot of softwares.;It's a good laptop for routine work not involving much graphics. Quality of body could have been better. Speaker audio is just about adequate. Worth the money paid;I received prodcut with defective speaker, sound quality is poor even at 100% volume. When I reached out to customer care they promised technician visit which did not happen, after called them again, I was promised return of the prodcut and refund to original payment. After multiple attempts, return was not picked up and refund was not provided. Amazon customer care told me, they started investigation why carrier did not pick-up and asked me wait for couple of days for resolution.  When I called after 3 days, I was told, everything is good on their side and they can not provide refund and won't be taking return as well.  This is daylight cheating and fradualent activity.  Customer care agent will provide template response and there is no esclation matrix for grievences.  I'm going to consumer court for on this matter.;Purchased this laptop to connect to office Citrix desktop and do work from home. Great speed and easy connectivity. I use my headset for audio and separate webcam for video calls so not tested the inbuilt webcam and speaker but should be pretty good. Worth the money and purchase.;Speed-5 starLooks-5 starCons- very less Usb ports and no LAN portOverall best choice.;The media could not be loaded.My personal review:1.Performance(Ram-16gb)Laptop runs smoothly even when you are multitasking and handles multiple tab opening easily.If you are not a heavy gamer ( you can play casual gaming easily  as well) but insteadwant a laptop for daily or office use, you will surely like this laptop.2. DisplayThe display is more than clear enough to watch movies or any content( obviously some would argue Oled display is better;but they come at a higher price as well).3.BatteryBattery lasts for around 3 hrs on a continuous usage( battery life could be better , but it's still ok at the price range)4.SoundSound quality is also good and clear .Sound loudness is more than enough , in my above video, the music video is being played at 56 volume which itself is loud enough for me.5.HeatingPersonally , not a heavy gamer , so heating has not been an issue for me.Final Review -If you never had a laptop and is thinking of getting this laptop, go for it , you won't get a better laptop at this price range.;In my point of this laptop is very very good because of its sound,screen,keyboard,and branding it has only one thing that is not good is it has not backlit if you think in photo it screen is not good but no my phone camera quality is not good if you think you will buy this laptop then you must and over all this laptop is so good and also have 65W charger",

SO THE ONLY UPGRADE POSSIBLE FOR THE 1x16GB MODEL IS CHANGING IT TO DUAL CHANNEL 2x8GB.Found out the hard and sad way, also confirmed with Lenovo.Old:The other review covers it very well, it will run whatever you throw at it.I left Red Dead Redemption 2 running for 20 hours straight. resumed playing still ran like butter.It comes with 2nd NVME slot but no screw so you'll have to procure it separately.Others count lack of RGB as a con, but I'll say White looks professional, wich goes with the overall look of the laptop, making it suitable for use in professional environments if you don't want everyone around you knowing you're a gamer.not being able to charge via the USB C is understandable with 170 W in the adaptor.90W TDP is boost TPG it will show lower but boosts it to 90W. remains cool without throttling even for longer heavy workloads, hint 20hours of RDR2.I recommend buying a 2nd NVME along with your purchase as you'll run out of 500 gigs quick.The included disk is a WD BLue SN530, not the best but good performance, not something you'll find slow in your daily usage unless your work is copying > 200 gig everyday.2Gig of the 16GB included ram go to VRAM .;I bought the 24gb ram, i7 13th nvidia 4050 version. The performance is stellar. I enabled windows ultimate performance in power management options from cmd. I also updated the bios using Lenovo website as the system was prompting the same. The gaming is butter smooth. Temperature management is also very good. I take breaks between 1.5 hour rounds by shutting off the computer when the fan noise peaks. Easily a powerhorse. Lenovo vantage is also very useful in managing power requirements and fan noise. Be sure to remove the paper cover on the charger and keep the charger standing on the long edge/side. Being a laptop it is also advisable to play on full charge with plugged on set up. Keyboard and trackpad are also very very professional. Display is ok ok. For 94000 this is a good gaming plus professional laptop.;I bought this laptop and upon  100% charging,  it gets drained within 3 hours if laptop remains idle, drains within one and half hour if you are watching a YouTube video or using multiple excel files. If you are playing games then it barely lasts till an hour. Very very bad battery life. It is complete waste of money.;Bought it for price 78k on December 2023. Have been using it for 8 months.Most of the modern AAA titles run at 1080p 60fps.The screen refresh rate is 165Hz, which if bought separately costs a lot.The CPU has 8 cores and 16 Threads, which is enough for any programming, rendering, compilation or virtualization.The Ryzen 7 5800H also has a RX Vega 8 APU graphics which can be used for encoding while streaming, while your main game runs on RTX 3060I have tested linux on it as well, after disabling secure boot, and installing Nvidia drivers for Nvidia optimus also works and is hassle free.The only cons might be both the USB ports being on the right side. And the battery-life, but that is to be expected of any gaming laptop.;So this is my second gaming laptop, first one being the Legion Y520 (i5 7th gen, GTX 1050). That laptop lasted 6 years for me and is currently being used by my sister.Few reasons why I opted for this laptop in particular:CPU and GPU combination - Ryzen 7 5800H, RTX 3060 @90W TDPDisplay - 165Hz, 100% SRGBPrice: Got it for 89,990Originally I wanted the MSI Alpha 15 Advantage edition that has the same CPU, but comes with 8GB Radeon 6600M. It was slightly expensive and delivery by Flipkart was quite slow for my address, so I didn't go for it. There were 2 other options from MSI that have RTX 3060 and shipped with i7 CPU, but they did not have color accurate displays (45% color gamut). For these reasons Ideapad gaming 3 became the perfect pick for me and I am impressed with my purchase. Boot times are of course great and games load significantly fast, of course. I am planning to  add a 1TB SSD and additional 16GB RAM later which will improve the performance even further!Following games have been tested by me so far on ultra to medium settings:World of Warships - average FPS 100-120 @ ultra settingsWitcher 3 - 60 FPS on ultra settings. For some reason the FPS for this game are locked at 60A Plague Tale: Innocence - 90-120 FPS on medium to ultra settingsForza Horizon 4 -  did not have FPS enable at that time so could not see the actual FPS, but it looked great so I'll assume it was in the range mentioned aboveI am planning to try out more games and will update my review accordingly. But so far I am happy with my purchase and can recommend this laptop to future buyers with confidence. Trackpad is quite awesome too,  don't know though which driver it is using. Keyboard is great as well, but I use an external keyboard anyway so it does not matter to me. Speakers are satisfactory. They are placed at the bottom and deliver good sound both in terms of quality and loudness.The device is surprisingly lightweight which is a good thing! Build quality could have been better, but it is definitely not fragile. Keyboard is white backlit only, so no RGB lighting available. I am not into the fancy RGB lighting so it does not bother me at all. I am also thankful that it does not come with red lighting on the keyboard!Thank you Amazon for quick delivery (16 hours) and thank you Lenovo for this good product.Edit: I forgot the mention that I played for three hours straight and did not experience any kind of performance throttling. Boot up is almost instant which is expected. Note that it comes with 1x 16GB RAM and my laptop came with WD SN530 SSD. You have one more slot for RAM and SSD each and I've read somewhere that the laptop can support NVMe Gen 4 SSDs, but not sure whether that's true.;It is a damn good and very nice price laptop.People were saying that it has battery drain issue, but I found it good. The Battery lasts around 5hrs in normal work including photoshop. The body is strong, design is good. I loved the display.I was confused between the Infinix one and this one, but this one is much better as Lenovo has broader service area.",

                "text": "Definitely worth the purchase! Performance is perfect, build quality's the best I've seen on any laptop I've ever owned, doesn't heat up much even while gaming, size is just perfect too since it's almost as easy as carrying a tablet.. in love with the speakers too, which aren't that loud for outdoor usage but perfect crisp sound for streaming and calls.. windows works well, and Linux runs on steroids.. tried and tested Linux Mint, Pop_OS, MX Linux, Endeavour OS, Garuda Linux and Ubuntu (yup, I hate it the most, but still installed it for OCD's sake ;) ).. they ran smooth without any issues at all! The only con I hope gets sorted soon are the Goodix drivers for the fingerprint sensors on the Lenovo Thinkpad E14 Gen 5 are proprietary and not recognized out of the box on Linux. That being said, It's a beast worth buying, the upgradability is phenomenal!;Build Quality: 10/10Very good solid build, Metal top lid and sturdy base. Overall size reduced as compared to previous Gen ThinkPad 14inch models. Less weight.Display: 6/10WUXGA is not convenient for streaming videos as the width reduced by 1cm and height increased, maybe good for programming. FHD IPS is always better with wide screen. Also in the name of reducing blue light, they made the display colour profile little warm in this new WUXGA display.Performance: 8/10Decent performance for Ryzen 5 with 16GB RAM. Performance is good than HP ProBook with i5 12th gen.Keyboard: 7/10The new chicklet type keyboard with smaller keys and key spacing is not so convenient. ThinkPad fans would get disappointed for this new keyboard. Trackpad is good.Battery: 7/10 Heavy usage lasts for 2-3 hrs and Light usage lasts for 5-8 hrs.Overall, it's the config package is very good except WUXGA resolution and keyboard.;Edit after 1 year: It started having a weird problem where it's not turning on sometimes. Warranty expired just one month ago. Diagnostic test is showing no problem. Took to two different service centre but to no avail. Regretting buying from Amazon.The laptop is great to use. It's lightweight and that is one of its perks for me being a college student.Performance is good. I have played GTA V on low settings and FIFA 19.Battery is what you would expect. If you keep it on \"Best power efficiency\" and use it for normal office work then it will give you 8 hours of usage. Although this will reduce with time.One thing I dislike about it is that it's a fingerprint magnet. So now I'm looking for a cleaning kit! But other than that I'm happy with my purchase provided it runs fine for a few years.;One of the best built windows laptop. Got a great deal during independence day sale.Review after 1 month of use:Processor:-Ryzen 7530U is a best processor clubbed with 16GB RAM is very good for programming or running heavy applications.Keyboard:-I am not quite happy with the new keyboard in Gen 5 as compared to older gen. Lenovo says its more tactile but i feel it moved more towards chicket one which is not what a thinkpad user likes.Webcam:- Webcam could have been better. If there is a even a small light source opp. to the camera, images get very blur. In proper lighting it ok to use, but better to have a seperate webcam if your work requires frequent calls.Battery:- Battery backup is good for a window laptop. With Balanced setting it can easily last for 6-7 hours. Company claims 12 hrs which i feel is not possible and just a gimmick.Display:- Anti Glare screen is just amazing. you will love this if you are a developer and casual OTT consumer. However this is a IPS panel which i feel is the biggest upgrade from older gen thinkpads at this price range, but max brightness is slightly on the lower side of 250 nits. I may be feeling this slightly more i as i used Macbook Air M1 which has around 400 nits with retina display. Since this being built for professional use, i wouldn't recommend this for graphic designing or photoshop due to low colour accuracy  in the displayPorts:Having 2 USB Type C port in Gen 5 is a great plus. You get 2 high speed type a as well. Having Lan and HDMI port is a great relief compared to my MacWin 11 & Office:Both comes pre installed and best part pre activated, you just need to link you office got and done.Overall a great laptop for developers and normal OTT consumer. Value for money product with military grade design.;Ryzen 5 7530U is enough for routine tasks.It is Lightweight and can be carried easily.You are going to like the black colour.Display is wuxga 300 nits and it is better than most laptops available in this price range.Sound is not that loud since it's a business laptop but during movies u won't feel that much lag as the sound quality is great.Battery Life is better than all the laptops I have used till date.;I am writing this review after using it from last 20 days.It's good, working smoothly \ud83d\udcaf;When it is clearly mentioned in the Amazon product details that''Operating System: Preloaded Windows 11 Home SL with Lifetime Validity",

Will not let it stop here;brought this at Rs. 6500.good for light work and light games.storage is 6gb.battery is 4800 mahchip is snapdragon 429 quad core;Charger quality is bad;I order lenova tab on 28th August 2024 and received on 6th September 2024 evening. But tab condition is not working and I want to place replacement but amazon executive said that no replacement from our side only service centre replacement only our replacement or return policy has been changeBut service centre is closed on Saturday and Sunday. It is too far from my house also and I travelled to the service centre on Monday and tell that issue im facing with this tab. That service centre staff said that no replacement for my product because I place order on 28th August 2024 they counted 7days from that date. But my order delivered on 6th september 2024 who should count date from place order. They simple said that we are not responsible for go and ask amazon simply escapedSo, please dont order electronics on amazon. If you got a damage one replacement or return the product is highly difficult;The media could not be loaded.I recently purchased a cover for my Lenovo M10 tablet, and it's been a great addition. The design fits perfectly, snapping securely around the tablet, which gives me peace of mind about protection. The cover is sturdy and has a nice finish, so it looks professional while being functional.One of the best features is the auto sleep/wake function\u2014it responds instantly whenever I open or close the cover, which helps conserve battery life. I also appreciate the adjustable stand, allowing me to switch between different viewing angles, whether I'm watching videos or typing.However, I would have preferred a slightly softer interior to protect the screen better when closed. Overall, this is a solid cover that enhances the tablet\u2019s usability while keeping it well-protected.;Perfect;The tab was a Dec 2020 make and the warranty had expired on June 2023, agree the product is lost at a lower price. But should have mentioned this in description that the device would be out of warranty.;",

The AMD Ryzen processor is strong enough for regular use at home.As opposed to what many mention, the laptop does come with a backlit keyboard.There is a pre-installed Microsoft Office also ready to use. Just have to create an account if you don't have one and login.;Okay review after 3 months ? 2 months ? Idk I forgot anyways, the laptop is bigger than you'd expect, slim, light, above average performance!Pros :Back-lit keyboardAccessibility is numerous,Ryzen Processor > IntelDisplay : LargeColour contrast : Vibrant Colour, FHDCharging takes less time !Value for money ? Big yes !(Better than Ausus, HP, sorry not sorry but all my families use different laptop that's much pricier than this laptop but it outperforms ausus vivobook, hp)Cons :\u2022 Not for heavy gaming as it drains quiet fast when you play games on it ( on 100% it drained quiet fast when I played DOTA)\u2022 Bluetooth tend to stop working when you're using a wireless mouse/keyboard and Bluetooth earbuds both connected to the laptop (you have to disconnect either the ear buds or the mouse)Camera : TRASH (Sorry not sorry)Conclusion: Dont play heavy games, good for academic works ( if you're not a developer don't stress on it but learn python at the least lol )Should you buy it ?Yes, if it's well within your budget(It's better than vivobook :D);I bought this Lenovo Ideapad laptop 3 months ago and after use of less than 2 months battery is not taking charge. I called the Amazon customer care they told me to contact Lenovo customer care for support. And when I called Lenovo customer care they checked the laptop virtually by taker controls from Rescue Lens application and found that there is a issue with battery. And after 3-4 days one of their technician come to replace the battery and after replacing the battery issue still remains same. Then he troubleshooted and told us that its motherboard having issues so they have to replace motherboard. I asked them to replace full unit but they are denying. I again called the customer care of lenovo but they are denying to replace the unit. Also, when I bought this unit I found that the warranty on site shows expired. I think these lenovo company guys are so unprofessional and there is no management and quality check of the products.  At last I want to say please dont buy this product its unreliable.....Its waste of money.;Works excellentHas all featuresBattery works for good 5-6 hours on continuous working and watching video.Very smooth and sleek.Value for money.;;It doesn't have backlit keyboard but the device performance is efficient. Loads windows under 10 secs and no log observed so far. The sound quality is really good.;Every thing is good but you can not control blacklit keyboard intensity light. You can just turn it on or off. You can't change it to low, medium and high. And fingerprint senseor is not compatible for the hello window is showing.Good pointsPerformance is goodBattery is goodBad pointsYou can't ajust the light of keyboard. But you can it on/offFingerprint senor is not working error is showing.;Really good product from Lenovo. Awesome backlit. Very good display.",

Super fast booting, sleek design, anti glare screen are some of the positives of this laptop. Comes with preloaded MS Office and Windows 11. Even smaller details like shutter for camera (we can actually close the camera when we aren't using the camera) have been taken care of. I absolutely love this laptop. Had one lenova laptop few years back too. Very sturdy laptops! I love this!;Display is poor.WIFI is going off all of sudden and every time we have to restart.. technical support is not able to solve the issue after 2 attempts...i would not recommend this product to anyone.;Overall, the product is quite good, but the battery drains rather quickly.

So yeah again normal-normal.Hardware is top notch, the keyboard quality is good.So all in all it is very good laptop, it will get all your normal needs done, go for it ,you will get it in 45k in sale.;Light weight easy to carry, good processor for day to day office work with home 11 and Ms office pre installed. Screen brightness is decent indoor but speaker is pathetic so not recommended for multimedia use case. If you want a laptop for office work with low budget below 50k go for it. I got it for 39k with bank office in great Indian sales and satisfied with it.;The product I received has issues with both hardware and software. The hardware is not functioning properly, and the software is also problematic. Additionally, the system is not working smoothly as expected. Please address these issues and provide a solution at the earliest.;battery drains fast runs only for 3.5 hrperformance is good but after 6-7 hrs of continuous use for study starts to lag and does not loadbuy for 32k through credit card and exchange offerotherwise don't  buy;After using it for a day -Display : pretty goodSpeakers - Below averageBattery life - GoodCamera - GoodPerformed well in dead pixel and keyboard functionality test.Overall amazing laptop for the price .....;Does my job without any hiccups. Happy with the purchase.;Quality and functionality is smooth.Seems best product and got it for 40k during the sale.Battery life is good.Camera quality and sound is just Ok.",

                "text": "Thanks to amazon for giving massive discount on my sbi card during republic day sale which made it possible for me to get this beast. It performs as you think it would.Everything runs buttery smooth but there is battery drop issue i think 230w adapter will fix that aside from that there is not problem and rgb backlight keyboard would have been cool.;So the best thing about this laptop is that the build quality is sturdy. Do note that this processor has no iGPU so your battery life is limited to 4 hours and does not go higher than that when not plugged in. That being said a friend of mine got the G14 zyphrus and we were gaming at max settings and this laptop did not hit 60 degrees whereas the G14 was touching 85 degrees hence the cooling system is amazing. Another thing I have realised is that I don\u2019t use the laptop when it isn\u2019t plugged in and I do not require 15 -20 hrs of battery life. Also all tasks and jobs run very smoothly on this and I feel its worth the trade off for price and hardware;Got it at 71k, faced a screen flickering issue after 2 days but other than that it worths every single penny in terms of display and gaming. It has better display and gaming performance then nitro and victus.;As people have mentioned previously, the main issue is due to unavailablity of iGPU which spoils the battery life. Overall a decent laptop and worth the price.I\u2019ll edit my comms after using it for a couple of months;This lap when fully charged shuts down in just one hour even with usage without the internet. I bought this gaming laptop expecting it's efficiency. But never expected such a low quality battery in such a new age laptop. What is the use of any technology if you can't use it. Imagine you buy a phone with all the latest technology from the top brand but battery dies  in qn 1 hour, will you buy? Even if it's given for free you won't use it. I wonder why companies even make such useless laptops. Horrible experience from Lenovo, never expected. I feel cheated and and have lost 80,000 I paid for this.;So far i am really satisfied with my Laptop. Yes there are some things that could have been better. Like the brightness could have been better. But the colour accuracy and all is good. The build is noce. Speaker quality is good not so bad but could have been better. It is on a heavier side but you know it is a gaming laptop. Many people complaint about the fan noise but i think most of the gaming laptops have this thing. It is just to keep your machine cool you can ignore that. The fan speed can be kept in quiet mode in normal usage. Battery life if you ask me lasted for 2.5-3hrs but i saw a minor charge drop while i was using heavily. 170w charger is not enough. J suggest you contact the customer care and get a 230w one. I bought it for \u20b969k during republic day sale. I think its worth every penny.;Everything is very good but battery is equally bad;After all settings down and in igpu mode and 60hz it around 4 hours itz pretty good but not sufficient for students i think \ud83e\udd14 70 wh ki battery deni chahiye inko",

                "text": "I recently bought this refurbished Lenovo laptop from Amazon and have been using it for a few weeks now. I am happy with the laptop's performance and condition. The item arrived in excellent condition, and the packaging was great. The laptop is working perfectly fine without any significant problems thus far.Things i likeThe performance for everyday tasks like browsing, streaming, and office work is excellent. I personally use it for excel, PPT and it functions flawlessly. - The battery life is satisfactory. - The display is sharp and vibrant. - The keyboard and touchpad provide a comfortable user experience.In my opinion, this laptop is a great choice for those seeking a dependable and reasonably priced option.;I purchased this refurbished laptop two weeks ago, and overall, I feel it's a good buy. However, I want to highlight a few important points for potential buyers.First, be aware that multiple sellers offer the same configuration, and the reviews shown might be for all sellers combined. Ensure you buy from the right seller. I bought mine from Syntronic Official, and I must say the laptop is of good quality. There were minimal scratches, and the performance is impressive. I suspect they have provided a new battery, though I'm not sure if it's an original Lenovo battery.The packaging was good, ensuring the laptop was not damaged during transit. However, I did encounter one issue: the serial number on the invoice did not match the serial number I retrieved from the BIOS using a command.Additionally, note that the Microsoft Office included is a trial version, as mentioned in the title.Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase from Syntronic Official and would recommend them for refurbished laptops.Update:After using the laptop for three months, I noticed a line running down the middle of the display. Since this is clearly a hardware issue, I reached out to the seller. After multiple inquiries, he finally asked me to send the laptop back. However, there was no assurance of when or even if I would get the laptop returned, and no clear communication was given.The problem is, we buy laptops to get work done, and sending it away for repairs without any timeline is impractical. What if it takes a month to get it back? I only realized how frustrating this process could be after going through it myself.So, if you're considering purchasing a refurbished laptop, I recommend buying it from a nearby offline store. That way, repairs can be handled more easily and quickly.;I purchased from techify IT bazaar,thanks techify it baazar at only \u20b914209 ,I have using this device for last 4 days , I got everything what i excepted \u2763\ufe0f. Original charger,1920*1080 display with 60hz refresh rate,2*4gb samsung ram, 256 sata ssd which is low  ,i5 7300u best in this price , everything is working, . When I got there were two problems, power button was not working properly, and screen flickering while removing and insert the charger . I have solved this problem, if anyone getting this problem, you can do -> go to Control panel -> power options -> change plan settings -> change advanced power settings -> Intel graphics settings -> choose maximum performance for both On battery and plugged .;It is good . It is a laptop in the price of mobile.;Brother do not buy a second hand laptop, they sell bad products. The problem started right after I purchased it but by the time I understood it I was too late and did not see the return policy period. This was my mistake. There is a big issue with the battery, it does not charge above 60% even after charging it for 24 hours and the back up is not for even 3 hours. Apart from that, the keyboard issue is different and the laptop gets very hot and makes noise. I made a mistake by purchasing it. Bad waste product.;Battery backup 2hrDisplay full HDQuality superTotally super laptop;The product is as good as new and has been working flawlessly for the last 6 months;Laptop keyboard is not fixed properly lock are visible.Also laptop battery is defective. They have mentioned they did full proof quality check and hardware bis defective.its really a bad experience.",

Probably they need to update the drivers. No heating issue. Bundled software are very good & more than enough for normal work. All are genuine softwares and get registered with Microsoft. Device also gets registered in Lenovo portal for 1 year premium care + 1 accidental damage protection. OLED screen is superb. Charger is wall socket type (not brick type) and I like it. I haven't checked battery backup hours. I haven't used it for gaming. For Rs. 56k after exchange and card offer, this is the best value for money. By the way, both variants 83DA0049IN (Rs. 77 k) and 83DA003GIN (Rs. 81.5k) are the same, when verified from Lenovo spec sheet. Not sure why they are priced differently.;I received this brand new laptop just yesterday, and while it performs well, I've already noticed a couple of concerning issues. First, I feel a mild electrical shock through the chassis whenever it's charging\u2014the metal body tingles when touched, which is quite uncomfortable. Additionally, the sound is disappointingly low, especially compared to a smartphone, and could definitely be better to complement the otherwise amazing display.;Love this laptop from the time I saw it. Half being a fan of Lenovo slim pad series, and this one with the new Intel ultra processor is just the icing on the cake..It's amazingly light and form factor resembles a MacBook to a large extent. Battery backup is perfect for a full day use. Screen is bright, bright and large enough for any business use. Impeccable quality. Overall performance is just amazing.;Laptop is good with latest ultra processor, fast and smooth. I have noticed 2 cons.1. Laptop speakers are very bad, sound less than my mobile speakers.2.

                "text": "Intel's Evo platform standards, which emphasizes features like fast wake times, long battery life, and high performance:1- Good Battery Backup: laptop has a long-lasting battery, which is a key feature of Intel Evo-certified devices.2- Fast Boot-up: The quick startup suggests that the laptop utilizes fast storage technology, such as SSDs, to boot up quickly.3- Good Performance: As an Evo-certified laptop, it's expected to deliver solid performance, likely powered by a high-performance CPU and GPU.4- Awesome Camera Quality:laptop likely has a high-quality webcam, which is important for video conferencing and streaming.5- Clear Audio with Dolby Sound: The inclusion of Dolby sound suggests that the laptop offers high-quality audio output, enhancing the multimedia experience.6- OLED Display for Good Clarity: OLED displays typically offer vibrant colors and deep blacks, providing excellent clarity and contrast for visual content.Overall, a laptop with these features would likely offer a premium computing experience suitable for a range of tasks, from productivity to multimedia consumption and content creation.;Review after 4 Months of usage. I am thoroughly impressed. The performance delivered by the Intel Evo Core Ultra 9 185H processor and the Intel Arc GPU is exceptional, handling intensive tasks with ease. The 14\" 2.8K-OLED display is a visual treat, offering vibrant colors and sharp details at a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. The laptop's build quality is top-notch, and it feels sturdy yet lightweight at just 1.4kg.The addition of built-in AI features enhances productivity, making tasks feel more intuitive. With 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD, multitasking and storage are a breeze. The FHD+ IR Camera ensures clear video calls, and the one-year ADP free service is a nice bonus. Overall, the Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 excels in both performance and quality, making it a worthwhile investment.Applications used;If any problem comes. Amazon is worst than any retail shop. The app just keeps going in circle when you try to connect with customer service. From the internet I somehow connected to their customer service. But I felt sorry for them as they don't have any clear instructions. Lenovo gave a DOA and seal packed the laptop. More than three weeks now. I am left with DOA and seal packed laptop. My money is struck and no laptop to use.;After getting white screen innmy iphone 13 pro after 17.5.1 update I wanted to tell bye bye for apple products . So I was searching replacement for my macbook pro  since last 3 weeks . After researching a lot this one felt like a good choice in every aspects , display , performance, gaming .Having core ultra 9 is very good for any task , Intel arc graphics is integrated , but it's equivalent to 4gb graphics of 3050 series and pretty good . 32 gb ram is all enough for anything. First time in my life I never heard fan sound when Android studio running with emulator, which shows how good this laptop is in terms of performance. Played couple of games via game pass I got and they were good , but size of games are like 129 gb and all , that was surprising to me as I played games in laptop after years . But 1 tb SSD is all enough to have such 5 games . Battery life came 7 hours for me for mixed usage . As a security professional running kali linux in virtual box was very smooth and I didn't expect so much good performance for the price . So it's value for money. As by combining offers I got it around 86 k . It have amazing display and brightness, which even beats so called retina displays  . Totally satisfied with the choice i made.;The laptop has good build quality with full metal body, looks slik and professional much like Mac. I will go as far as calling it the Lenovo's MacBook.\ud83d\ude04 The display is fairly, would have been best if we did not get a lot of glare and reflection. Display is bright.However there are some minor cons are there to take away the 5th star. Heating is an issue with all laptops from this segment and this is not an exception, they did cost cut through build quality of Touch Pad and keyboard, the quality of both feels cheap. Last is the sound, well, don't expect much buy a good quality earphone.;I\u2019ve been using this laptop for a few weeks now, and I\u2019m thoroughly impressed with its performance! From the moment I powered it on, everything runs incredibly smooth. The speed is remarkable, whether I\u2019m multitasking with multiple apps, editing large files, or even gaming. The processor handles everything I throw at it without any signs of slowing down.The display is stunning\u2014sharp and vibrant, which makes working for long hours much easier on the eyes. Battery life is also a pleasant surprise, lasting me through a full day of heavy use without needing to recharge constantly. And the design? Sleek and modern, making it perfect for both work and play.Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a laptop that delivers in terms of speed, performance, and looks, this is an excellent choice. Definitely worth every penny! Highly recommended.;Given the configuration it is the best laptop. Performance is Excellent. Weight is light. I loved the Sound Quality. Ease of use. Boots within the blink of eye. The Build Quality is excellent. Original Product.;I checked a Asus Zenbook, and Vivobook models before finalizing on this model. The display is excellent, the CPU is top tier, and the form factor is perfect for portability. On a light to heavy workload I got about 4-5 hours of battery life. I ran about 4 VMs on VMWare Workstation, and still it stayed around 75-80 Deg. C. The build quality is good. This laptop, with a Intel Evo Core Ultra 9 185H is good value for money, esp. when the competition sells for more than 1.5L",

Size and weight is not too much. All together it is value for money.;The media could not be loaded.Using it for a month and a halfPros:16gb ram is a wise choice for a coder.Screen Quality is good (Don't know why there were a lot of negative reviews about it), Genuine Windows 11 and MS office (great for students and content creators),Lightweight, easy and fast.Drawbacks:audio could have been better ( I use earphones and speaker so not an issue for me).definitely not a gaming laptop even if it advertises as such (xbox 3 month pass and I couldn't use it because video memory is lower than my previous lap)no backlit keyboard (it's not available in any IdeaPad slim 1)the metal body easily gets scratched and chipped (my advise is buy laptop bag or skin immediately, even a week is too late)Comment: first time ryzen user and gotta say it's good for everything outside gaming. Students and soft computer users can definitely go for this. If you're a gamer I would advise i5 and something with a graphic card. 16gb ram is better if you use a lot of softwares.;It's a good laptop for routine work not involving much graphics. Quality of body could have been better. Speaker audio is just about adequate. Worth the money paid;I received prodcut with defective speaker, sound quality is poor even at 100% volume. When I reached out to customer care they promised technician visit which did not happen, after called them again, I was promised return of the prodcut and refund to original payment. After multiple attempts, return was not picked up and refund was not provided. Amazon customer care told me, they started investigation why carrier did not pick-up and asked me wait for couple of days for resolution.  When I called after 3 days, I was told, everything is good on their side and they can not provide refund and won't be taking return as well.  This is daylight cheating and fradualent activity.  Customer care agent will provide template response and there is no esclation matrix for grievences.  I'm going to consumer court for on this matter.;Purchased this laptop to connect to office Citrix desktop and do work from home. Great speed and easy connectivity. I use my headset for audio and separate webcam for video calls so not tested the inbuilt webcam and speaker but should be pretty good. Worth the money and purchase.;Speed-5 starLooks-5 starCons- very less Usb ports and no LAN portOverall best choice.;The media could not be loaded.My personal review:1.Performance(Ram-16gb)Laptop runs smoothly even when you are multitasking and handles multiple tab opening easily.If you are not a heavy gamer ( you can play casual gaming easily  as well) but insteadwant a laptop for daily or office use, you will surely like this laptop.2. DisplayThe display is more than clear enough to watch movies or any content( obviously some would argue Oled display is better;but they come at a higher price as well).3.BatteryBattery lasts for around 3 hrs on a continuous usage( battery life could be better , but it's still ok at the price range)4.SoundSound quality is also good and clear .Sound loudness is more than enough , in my above video, the music video is being played at 56 volume which itself is loud enough for me.5.HeatingPersonally , not a heavy gamer , so heating has not been an issue for me.Final Review -If you never had a laptop and is thinking of getting this laptop, go for it , you won't get a better laptop at this price range.;In my point of this laptop is very very good because of its sound,screen,keyboard,and branding it has only one thing that is not good is it has not backlit if you think in photo it screen is not good but no my phone camera quality is not good if you think you will buy this laptop then you must and over all this laptop is so good and also have 65W charger",

                "text": "Thanks to amazon for giving massive discount on my sbi card during republic day sale which made it possible for me to get this beast. It performs as you think it would.Everything runs buttery smooth but there is battery drop issue i think 230w adapter will fix that aside from that there is not problem and rgb backlight keyboard would have been cool.;So the best thing about this laptop is that the build quality is sturdy. Do note that this processor has no iGPU so your battery life is limited to 4 hours and does not go higher than that when not plugged in. That being said a friend of mine got the G14 zyphrus and we were gaming at max settings and this laptop did not hit 60 degrees whereas the G14 was touching 85 degrees hence the cooling system is amazing. Another thing I have realised is that I don\u2019t use the laptop when it isn\u2019t plugged in and I do not require 15 -20 hrs of battery life. Also all tasks and jobs run very smoothly on this and I feel its worth the trade off for price and hardware;Got it at 71k, faced a screen flickering issue after 2 days but other than that it worths every single penny in terms of display and gaming. It has better display and gaming performance then nitro and victus.;As people have mentioned previously, the main issue is due to unavailablity of iGPU which spoils the battery life. Overall a decent laptop and worth the price.I\u2019ll edit my comms after using it for a couple of months;This lap when fully charged shuts down in just one hour even with usage without the internet. I bought this gaming laptop expecting it's efficiency. But never expected such a low quality battery in such a new age laptop. What is the use of any technology if you can't use it. Imagine you buy a phone with all the latest technology from the top brand but battery dies  in qn 1 hour, will you buy? Even if it's given for free you won't use it. I wonder why companies even make such useless laptops. Horrible experience from Lenovo, never expected. I feel cheated and and have lost 80,000 I paid for this.;So far i am really satisfied with my Laptop. Yes there are some things that could have been better. Like the brightness could have been better. But the colour accuracy and all is good. The build is noce. Speaker quality is good not so bad but could have been better. It is on a heavier side but you know it is a gaming laptop. Many people complaint about the fan noise but i think most of the gaming laptops have this thing. It is just to keep your machine cool you can ignore that. The fan speed can be kept in quiet mode in normal usage. Battery life if you ask me lasted for 2.5-3hrs but i saw a minor charge drop while i was using heavily. 170w charger is not enough. J suggest you contact the customer care and get a 230w one. I bought it for \u20b969k during republic day sale. I think its worth every penny.;Everything is very good but battery is equally bad;After all settings down and in igpu mode and 60hz it around 4 hours itz pretty good but not sufficient for students i think \ud83e\udd14 70 wh ki battery deni chahiye inko",

No technician came and it reflects in the account that technician visit done.;Value for money;Touch pad is not working properly;Very good product;AMAZON has sent faulty laptop and still not getting return/replacement for the same;I purchased i7 + 16gb RAM config because I have to do heavy data science work using Python, SQL and Excel. But forget data science, this laptop becomes super sluggish and slow even with a few excel sheets. If a few chrome tabs are open, then doing any other work tends to freeze the laptop, and Restarting is the only option. This is not expected from a reputed brand as Lenovo.I also checked if CPU/RAM usage is unnecessarily high because of some background processes, but couldn't find any culprits. The task manager usage stats seems normal , and yet the laptop is a nightmare when doing even little heavy work. Returning this piece to buy some other brand.",

I called the Amazon customer care they told me to contact Lenovo customer care for support. And when I called Lenovo customer care they checked the laptop virtually by taker controls from Rescue Lens application and found that there is a issue with battery. And after 3-4 days one of their technician come to replace the battery and after replacing the battery issue still remains same. Then he troubleshooted and told us that its motherboard having issues so they have to replace motherboard. I asked them to replace full unit but they are denying. I again called the customer care of lenovo but they are denying to replace the unit. Also, when I bought this unit I found that the warranty on site shows expired. I think these lenovo company guys are so unprofessional and there is no management and quality check of the products.  At last I want to say please dont buy this product its unreliable.....Its waste of money.;Works excellentHas all featuresBattery works for good 5-6 hours on continuous working and watching video.Very smooth and sleek.Value for money.;;It doesn't have backlit keyboard but the device performance is efficient. Loads windows under 10 secs and no log observed so far. The sound quality is really good.;Every thing is good but you can not control blacklit keyboard intensity light. You can just turn it on or off. You can't change it to low, medium and high. And fingerprint senseor is not compatible for the hello window is showing.Good pointsPerformance is goodBattery is goodBad pointsYou can't ajust the light of keyboard.

You can go for it.;They only provide DP port with CPU. Either change the description/image that there is no VGA, HDMI ports or provide one with it. Otherwise working fine. I had to purchase DP to VGA cable separately.;Computer stopped working after three months...I have to arrange mechanic to restart it;Guys mostly I doesn't write any reviews basically..I wrote the reviews only when it's most positive product and most negative product..Bcz every negative reviews affected the seller and their businesses..So I wrote the top most negative product reviews only and top most positive products too..This time this seller MMT GLOBAL is met beyond my expectations so that I write my reviews..First I got a different specification product after that I raised my request through the Amazon.. After that immediately the seller contacted me and asking contact details and then they asked my address details to ship the exact specification product which they mentioned in their ad..After within 2days they shipped the exact product with the third party courier..It reached me within one week before they took my old product..After that they initiated the old pickup with the third party courier..Yeah I know this courier charges they paid from their pocket.. Excellent seller and I felt they never work for only money bcz they send the DP to HDMI adaptor with the replacement product \u2763\ufe0f\ud83e\udd73most of the sellers not provided anything with that..And they installed every softwares and drivers without any errors..Clean and clear installations\ud83d\udcaf..And their packaging gets more than \ud83d\udcaf marks..They respect their customers and provided the valuable services to them..First I was very skeptical before place my order bcz there is no(zero) reviews in their portal and they sold at very very lowest price than the other sellers..And I took the riskiest buy..Bt after that they overtaken my all expectations..So pls assure before placing the order the seller name MMT GLOBAL..I hope this will useful for someone who is in the confused state of mind while placing the order like me..And also they provided 6 months warranty for this product so I hope they will rectify the problems if anything occurs in future..\ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd1d\u2763\ufe0f\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udd73\ud83d\udd25;Product came 100% as advertised. All the components as descripted. Keyboard and mouse brand new. Power brick included, OS installed. The machine looks like brand new. Thank you very much.;I recently purchased the Lenovo ThinkCenter M910Q Renewed Business Tiny PC from Amazon with high hopes, but unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. Despite being advertised as renewed/refurbished, the product I received showed clear signs of not being properly refurbished.Upon starting the PC, I immediately noticed several issues. The trash can contained a trail of deleted files, and there were random video clips left on the desktop, indicating a lack of proper cleanup. Furthermore, the Windows activation key presented an error, adding to the frustration.Given the discrepancies between the advertised condition and the actual state of the product, I find it unacceptable. Especially considering the price I paid, AED 444, when there was a used option available for AED 310 on Amazon. This price difference makes it illogical to choose a supposedly refurbished product over a used one, especially considering the potential savings.Overall, my experience with the Lenovo ThinkCenter M910Q Renewed Business Tiny PC was highly disappointing, and I would advise potential buyers to exercise caution when considering refurbished options. I rate this product -5 stars.;Received item in good condition and well packaged. The mini pc itself was missing a screw but it didn\u2019t affect functionality. Been using it for about 6 months and I hope it remains functional for a few more years.;\u062a\u0645 \u0637\u0644\u0628 \u0644\u064a\u0646\u0648\u0641\u0648 m910q  \u0648\u0644\u0627\u0643\u0646 \u0648\u0635\u0644\u0646\u064a m710q \u0627\u064a\u0636\u0627\u064b  \u062c\u0648\u062f\u0629 \u0648\u0633\u064a\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062e\u0632\u064a\u0646 \u0636\u0639\u064a\u0641\u0629\u0639\u0645\u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0631 \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628 \u0644\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0629 \u0648\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u062a\u062c;4.5 stars+ Same as mentioned in the listing+ The item looks new or extremely low usage rather than used+ Has a generic 802.11n- The SSD that's included is some crappy Chinese one which is worse than an HDD.

Size and weight is not too much. All together it is value for money.;The media could not be loaded.Using it for a month and a halfPros:16gb ram is a wise choice for a coder.Screen Quality is good (Don't know why there were a lot of negative reviews about it), Genuine Windows 11 and MS office (great for students and content creators),Lightweight, easy and fast.Drawbacks:audio could have been better ( I use earphones and speaker so not an issue for me).definitely not a gaming laptop even if it advertises as such (xbox 3 month pass and I couldn't use it because video memory is lower than my previous lap)no backlit keyboard (it's not available in any IdeaPad slim 1)the metal body easily gets scratched and chipped (my advise is buy laptop bag or skin immediately, even a week is too late)Comment: first time ryzen user and gotta say it's good for everything outside gaming. Students and soft computer users can definitely go for this. If you're a gamer I would advise i5 and something with a graphic card. 16gb ram is better if you use a lot of softwares.;It's a good laptop for routine work not involving much graphics. Quality of body could have been better. Speaker audio is just about adequate. Worth the money paid;I received prodcut with defective speaker, sound quality is poor even at 100% volume. When I reached out to customer care they promised technician visit which did not happen, after called them again, I was promised return of the prodcut and refund to original payment. After multiple attempts, return was not picked up and refund was not provided. Amazon customer care told me, they started investigation why carrier did not pick-up and asked me wait for couple of days for resolution.  When I called after 3 days, I was told, everything is good on their side and they can not provide refund and won't be taking return as well.  This is daylight cheating and fradualent activity.  Customer care agent will provide template response and there is no esclation matrix for grievences.  I'm going to consumer court for on this matter.;Purchased this laptop to connect to office Citrix desktop and do work from home. Great speed and easy connectivity. I use my headset for audio and separate webcam for video calls so not tested the inbuilt webcam and speaker but should be pretty good. Worth the money and purchase.;Speed-5 starLooks-5 starCons- very less Usb ports and no LAN portOverall best choice.;The media could not be loaded.My personal review:1.Performance(Ram-16gb)Laptop runs smoothly even when you are multitasking and handles multiple tab opening easily.If you are not a heavy gamer ( you can play casual gaming easily  as well) but insteadwant a laptop for daily or office use, you will surely like this laptop.2. DisplayThe display is more than clear enough to watch movies or any content( obviously some would argue Oled display is better;but they come at a higher price as well).3.BatteryBattery lasts for around 3 hrs on a continuous usage( battery life could be better , but it's still ok at the price range)4.SoundSound quality is also good and clear .Sound loudness is more than enough , in my above video, the music video is being played at 56 volume which itself is loud enough for me.5.HeatingPersonally , not a heavy gamer , so heating has not been an issue for me.Final Review -If you never had a laptop and is thinking of getting this laptop, go for it , you won't get a better laptop at this price range.;In my point of this laptop is very very good because of its sound,screen,keyboard,and branding it has only one thing that is not good is it has not backlit if you think in photo it screen is not good but no my phone camera quality is not good if you think you will buy this laptop then you must and over all this laptop is so good and also have 65W charger",

So yeah again normal-normal.Hardware is top notch, the keyboard quality is good.So all in all it is very good laptop, it will get all your normal needs done, go for it ,you will get it in 45k in sale.;Light weight easy to carry, good processor for day to day office work with home 11 and Ms office pre installed. Screen brightness is decent indoor but speaker is pathetic so not recommended for multimedia use case. If you want a laptop for office work with low budget below 50k go for it. I got it for 39k with bank office in great Indian sales and satisfied with it.;The product I received has issues with both hardware and software. The hardware is not functioning properly, and the software is also problematic. Additionally, the system is not working smoothly as expected. Please address these issues and provide a solution at the earliest.;battery drains fast runs only for 3.5 hrperformance is good but after 6-7 hrs of continuous use for study starts to lag and does not loadbuy for 32k through credit card and exchange offerotherwise don't  buy;After using it for a day -Display : pretty goodSpeakers - Below averageBattery life - GoodCamera - GoodPerformed well in dead pixel and keyboard functionality test.Overall amazing laptop for the price .....;Does my job without any hiccups. Happy with the purchase.;Quality and functionality is smooth.Seems best product and got it for 40k during the sale.Battery life is good.Camera quality and sound is just Ok.",

Perfect for regular usage.;The packing is more or less good, but the tempered glass, is excellent in quality. It is scratchproof and dust proof. Fingerprints smudge are unavoidable, but overall good product in this price range. Its very easy to install, and comes in exact size.;Very easy to instalation with the help of screen guide, bubble free , Excellent screen coverage,i got very good product at the best price and i got it as expected.Thank you Amazon!  for getting me a good deal.;good quality nd perfect size !;This fits perfect on the device!I recieved a broken product, but I believe it must have happened during the shipping, but thanks to the seller for replacing the screenguard and for quality product with no air bubbles after installation!I bought this with a guess thinking it might not fit the Huawei Mediapad M5 with a display of 10.1 inch, and it fits perfect for the tab. I agree it's not covering edge to edge, but that is for a reason so as to not to peel off or break when we put on the casing or any back cover.Next time, I would like to try 10.3 inch display screen guard on 10.1inch, so that it might cover edge to edge (hoping).Good product, go for it!;The clarity is top notch, applying was a easy task plus the quality is satisfactory.Initially some bubbles formed up which gave me a scare but they went after a day.Definitely go for this glass as it's the best in this price range.;Although it fits ok but a little bit a little tension on any side will make it crack, I just put it on and try to put the cover which was tight enough to hold the tab properly but the little push cracked the screen and also the air bubbles and big portion bubbles of air underneath the screen at coupleof places would never go away no matter howMuch you try.I have been using screen protectors on iPhone. iPad, tablets and android phones but never had this issue. In a nut shell the quality can be technically lot better although it fits the device as described;Nice Product And Packing Recommended For OneplusPad Go 11.35.Thanks To Shop keeper And Amazone....\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d",

                "text": "Very good laptop. Don't focus on other reviews. Just take a time to read this.**The most important thing- The warranty of the laptop may have started before. So for correcting that log in Lenovo support and register yourself with the serial no. of laptop.Intel i5 12450H provides a high performance.1080p camera which is very good.1.5Wx2 speakers with a very loud sound.No heating issues.Battery life is good as per the processor oh H series.Another thing is that it doesn't have fingerprint sensor. So don't buy this laptop for sake of fingerprint Sensor.Conclusion -:Great laptop with great performance. Absolutely value for money. With great IPS display screen.;I recently purchased the Lenovo Slim 3 laptop and here are my thoughts on this device:Pros:Performance: The laptop boasts an impressive Intel Core i5 H series processor. It handles multitasking and daily computing tasks effortlessly, making it a reliable choice for both work and casual use.Display: Display quality is averageKeyboard, Webcam, and Touchpad Quality: The keyboard is comfortable and responsive, the webcam delivers clear video quality, and the touchpad is smooth and accurate.AI Features: The AI features are a welcome addition, enhancing the overall user experience with smart and intuitive functionalities.Slimpad 5 Series Features: This laptop includes the latest features from the Slimpad 5 series, adding extra value and usability.Bundled Software: The device comes with Microsoft Office Home 2021 with lifetime validity, a 3-month Xbox Game Pass subscription, and a 1-month McAfee antivirus trial. Activation of these was straightforward and hassle-free.Warranty Activation: Activating the warranty was a smooth and easy process, providing additional peace of mind.Cons:Fingerprint Sensor Issue: Despite the laptop having a fingerprint sensor, I encountered an issue where it cannot be activated. The message \"We cannot find a fingerprint scanner compatible with Windows Hello Fingerprint\" appears, making this feature unusable.Graphics Card: The Intel UHD graphics card is below average for high-intensity, high-end gaming. Gamers looking for robust graphics performance might be disappointed.Build Quality: The build quality is mixed. While the front build quality is good, the base of the laptop feels like it is made from low-grade plastic, which seems less durable. Additionally, the screen tends to shake when typing quickly, which can be distracting.In summary, the Lenovo Slim 3 is a solid laptop with great performance, high-quality keyboard, webcam, and touchpad, and useful AI features. However, the unusable fingerprint sensor, below-average graphics card, and some concerns about the build quality are notable drawbacks. If you can overlook these cons, it offers good value for its price.Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 (4/5);i bought it for child and it met all the requirements processor and battery etc;Battery drain within 2 hours, considered as H series laptop, the performance is poor in gaming, gta 5 running in 35-40 fps in 1080p all lower settings, touchpad is made of plastic, whole laptop build is plastic, camera is poor, speaker sound is very less. Infinix y1 plus is much better that lenovo slim 3;3 star because laptop is good but some cons psrts are there1. Very bad sound quality...2. Dragging battery very fastA part from this laptop performance is good...;Built-in speakers could have been better.Overall a good package.;The media could not be loaded.I like the display and performance I chose this laptop over Asus vivobook 15 bcoz of ips display.Performance is good and battery backup is also ok I use it on my table so it did not bother me It charges so fast.And Yes it's value for money I purchased it on big billion daysThe only disadvantage I got is that it's warranty I got only 7 months warrantyI don't know why it happens but that's the price of sale I think. \ud83e\udd72;Heal level,camera quality battery life",

Size and weight is not too much. All together it is value for money.;The media could not be loaded.Using it for a month and a halfPros:16gb ram is a wise choice for a coder.Screen Quality is good (Don't know why there were a lot of negative reviews about it), Genuine Windows 11 and MS office (great for students and content creators),Lightweight, easy and fast.Drawbacks:audio could have been better ( I use earphones and speaker so not an issue for me).definitely not a gaming laptop even if it advertises as such (xbox 3 month pass and I couldn't use it because video memory is lower than my previous lap)no backlit keyboard (it's not available in any IdeaPad slim 1)the metal body easily gets scratched and chipped (my advise is buy laptop bag or skin immediately, even a week is too late)Comment: first time ryzen user and gotta say it's good for everything outside gaming. Students and soft computer users can definitely go for this. If you're a gamer I would advise i5 and something with a graphic card. 16gb ram is better if you use a lot of softwares.;It's a good laptop for routine work not involving much graphics. Quality of body could have been better. Speaker audio is just about adequate. Worth the money paid;I received prodcut with defective speaker, sound quality is poor even at 100% volume. When I reached out to customer care they promised technician visit which did not happen, after called them again, I was promised return of the prodcut and refund to original payment. After multiple attempts, return was not picked up and refund was not provided. Amazon customer care told me, they started investigation why carrier did not pick-up and asked me wait for couple of days for resolution.  When I called after 3 days, I was told, everything is good on their side and they can not provide refund and won't be taking return as well.  This is daylight cheating and fradualent activity.  Customer care agent will provide template response and there is no esclation matrix for grievences.  I'm going to consumer court for on this matter.;Purchased this laptop to connect to office Citrix desktop and do work from home. Great speed and easy connectivity. I use my headset for audio and separate webcam for video calls so not tested the inbuilt webcam and speaker but should be pretty good. Worth the money and purchase.;Speed-5 starLooks-5 starCons- very less Usb ports and no LAN portOverall best choice.;The media could not be loaded.My personal review:1.Performance(Ram-16gb)Laptop runs smoothly even when you are multitasking and handles multiple tab opening easily.If you are not a heavy gamer ( you can play casual gaming easily  as well) but insteadwant a laptop for daily or office use, you will surely like this laptop.2. DisplayThe display is more than clear enough to watch movies or any content( obviously some would argue Oled display is better;but they come at a higher price as well).3.BatteryBattery lasts for around 3 hrs on a continuous usage( battery life could be better , but it's still ok at the price range)4.SoundSound quality is also good and clear .Sound loudness is more than enough , in my above video, the music video is being played at 56 volume which itself is loud enough for me.5.HeatingPersonally , not a heavy gamer , so heating has not been an issue for me.Final Review -If you never had a laptop and is thinking of getting this laptop, go for it , you won't get a better laptop at this price range.;In my point of this laptop is very very good because of its sound,screen,keyboard,and branding it has only one thing that is not good is it has not backlit if you think in photo it screen is not good but no my phone camera quality is not good if you think you will buy this laptop then you must and over all this laptop is so good and also have 65W charger",

Since the Lenovo logo used and images as well.

But this product has exceeded all my expectations. I received it in perfect packing with no scratches or fingerprints on it. I have been using it for about 1 month almost every day. I even contacted the seller to thank him as it looks completely new. I have used it continuously for hours and there had been no heating issues as well. This is perfect for my streams.;The media could not be loaded.I am extremely disappointed with this product. The primary reason I purchased this webcam was for the advertised privacy shutter. Upon receiving the product, I found that the privacy shutter was completely absent. This is a clear case of false advertising and a significant security breach.The lack of a privacy shutter renders the product useless for its intended purpose. I expected a product that prioritized user privacy, but instead, I received a product that compromised it.I demand a full refund and a replacement product with the advertised privacy shutter. This is unacceptable and a complete waste of my time and money.;Good;Everything related to this webcam is great. The only downside is with the wide angle. During meetings the other person can see your complete room so make sure you have a separate room before using this;I was a little skeptical about the product but it\u2019s working fantastic.;Camera quality way poor even in daylight.

                "text": "It is best in the price range.Pros :1. Very nice quality and worked better than expected in both well lighted and less lighted areas.2. Your image won't be blurry.3. Mic quality is very good.Cons :1. The cover for camera allows some light to pass through the edges which will be noticeable in video.2. Covers too much background area , this webcam camera works like wide angle camera.3. I said it has vey good mic but it's one drawback is that it will catch noise of someone talking in other room or a thing falling outside the room.I will suggest you to buy this webcam as it's quality better than logitech c270 webcam and others in this range .;The quality is top notch for a fair price. Great product if you laptop doesn't have a camera.;I had earlier bought Logitech Brio 100 - it had pathetic field of view (FOV) of 58\u00b0 making your face fully fill the screen at typical laptop distance / seems it is more suitable when using a large monitor placed farther away from your face. This Lenovo webcam is perfect with 90\u00b0 FOV - and this matches typical laptop integrated webcams. The resolution is good and image quality is top notch - crystal clear and sharp. Defiantly recommend this to anyone looking to use a webcam to be placed on top of the laptop screen.;Its only 2 mega pixel but quality is far far better than the inbuilt camera in majority of the laptops. Wide view with immediate responsiveness. The picture/vid quality is 3.5/5 in Windows 10 default app but improves significantly with 3rd party software. Wire is very long...its way more than sufficient. Build quality is awesome, with a slider to cover the camera which is useful in case camera switches on during a conference call without our knowledge. Two mics are amazing as they deliver crystal clear input...sound in video recording is crystal clear...wow...bought it for online classes...got 400 discount and cashback...highly recommend.;Easy to connect and use but picture and video quality has not met my expectation.;Web cam work but not Microphone. Google meet have both mic and cam access but mic doesn\u2019t work. I wish , I could have figured out this early to return it before return window closed. Now I am stuck with this junk. I purchased this for tv only :(Would not recommend this to use this cam in any android tv.;Pros1. Plug and play2. Cheap3. Acceptable Picture quality under proper lighting4. Privacy shutter5. Super light. Fits on the top of the monitorCons:1. Too wide angle. Your entire room will be visible2. No Lenovo custom software to control the zoom/quality. Not sure how to achieve 4X digital zoom mentioned. You can use OBS Studio (PC and Mac) or Nvidia GeForce broadcast (in PC) to achieve this though. Or, you can buy a tripod and keep it close to your face3. No USB C adapter provided (For Mac users)4. Audio is bad if used from a distance. Using a separate mic is recommended5. For low light, lots of image grain is visibleAt this price, this is recommended for attending classes/meetings. May work for streaming if the lighting is right.;Good quality camera with decent resolution in low light too. Was sceptical due to lower price, but it's really worth it to buy. Bought this for my TV with Jio settop box which supports camera for video calling using Jio Join app;Muito boa e bem constru\u00edda, cores bem forte qualidade de imagem e resolu\u00e7\u00e3o muito boa, tem um \u00e2ngulo de vis\u00e3o bem grande;When Logitech failed to come out with a Win 11 driver for my high-end Logitech Webcam Pro I felt abandoned by them. Luckily at the same time I was still fuming over them basically abandoning their customers, I own multiple Logitech wired and wireless trackball products for many years, I received an email from Tom's Hardware recommending this Lenovo unit. At 66% less than anything around it with _equivalent_ specs and quality, I jumped on it here on Amazon and I am TOTALLY PLEASED.A bonus is that is also have a sliding panel on the face of it that covers the camera lens. The sound, video quality, and software are all first class. I would highly recommend this to anyone.;After my built in camera on my laptop failed and numerous attempts to fix the problem I gave in and decided the easiest course of action would be a plug and play.The Lenovo was a recommended buy on Consumers Reports so went with a throughly rated product.  Literally a plug and play, with no software to download. I have no issue using on Zoom or MS Teams meeting.Good quality video and excellent sound.;Unbesch\u00e4digt top zustand;Great camera.

It has given the Delete button bigger in size, which increases the typing efficiency.;Product is good, Keyboard and Mouse excellent work but price is high 1499rs this is my opinion of my used to this product;First of all this product is a very good value for money, the build quality is really good and sturdy, it's fairly portable and sleek. The key travel is really good on the keyboard and the mouse is good as well, response time lag is not at all visible being an external keyboard, this is a well round product worth buying;It has nice chiclet keys. Key travel feels appropriate. I'm able to type faster than the membrane keyboard. Good ergonomics because the keyboard height is smaller and it has also got rubber feet for raising the height. I personally like the size of keycap. Every key is placed at comfortable distance from each other just because it has island keyboard design found in laptop. Overall, working pretty good, up until now.;Nothing special;I use it daily for my work from home purpose. Im not a programmer, if you are, i would suggest going for split keyboard and/or vertical mouse. I dont have an intense use of typing in my job, although there is fair amount of typing and or mouse movements.I have a comfortable mouse pad and also a wrist rest, which I think makes a difference when you use the keyboard and the mouse for long work hours like work from home. I have been using it slightly less than a year, perhaps 9-10 months or so. The mouse and keyboard have been reliable and serves me well. This keyboard and mouse is good in its own right, for fair amount of usage, but if its intense use like programmers and or similar task, then it would be best to go for split keyboard and/or vertical mouse.;awesome typing experience, I bought it as I saw someone's review that it will give you close to Thinkpad typing experience, I had a thinkpad and it does. Mouse is a little small if you want good grip and rest your hand on the mouse but it is worth the price;Earliear I had a \"Dell Kb216\" Keyboard and It was pathetic to the level i once thought to smash it!Dell keyboards in this price segment are cheap & disgusting , while \"Lenevo stood upto my expectations\".This keyboard doesn't flexes and keys are so smooth that it literally gives you laptop keys like feel(island key style).Moreover , the keys are sensitive and you don't need to press the keys hard like in Dell-KB216.I'am a programmer & although most of the time my work is done on my laptop, but  when I work on Desktop eventually i need a good keyboard, this keyboard is a bang for the buck!!Grab it !!

I purchased on 12-Aug-2022 so far it no issues.;This is a very good deal.I got it for \u20b9281 and it's a great mouse.Body is solid and clicks are goodIt's a bit small if you have big hands but that doesn't create any issue while using it.Scroller looks & works okay, let's see how long it lasts..There are two things I don't like about this mouse:1. The wire is very cheaply made2. The bottom surface does not have any padding to avoid wear & tear of the body which usually is given with most mouse.Apart from this it's a great mouse for \u20b9281 and definitely feels like it'll last for years unless there's any physical damage or the wire gives out..;I recently purchased the Lenovo 300 Wired Plug & Play USB Mouse from Amazon, and it has proven to be a reliable and efficient addition to my computing setup. Here\u2019s a detailed review based on my experience over the past month.First ImpressionsUpon receiving the mouse, I was immediately impressed with its sleek and ergonomic design. The matte black finish gives it a professional and modern look, making it suitable for both office and home environments. The mouse is lightweight yet feels solid, suggesting good build quality.Setup and Ease of UseAs the name suggests, the Lenovo 300 is a plug-and-play device. Setting it up was as simple as plugging the USB cable into my computer. It was instantly recognized by my system (Windows 10), and I was able to start using it right away without the need for any additional drivers or software. This straightforward setup process is a significant advantage for those who prefer hassle-free devices.PerformanceThe performance of the Lenovo 300 Wired USB Mouse has been outstanding. It features a high-resolution 1600 DPI optical sensor, which provides smooth and precise cursor control. This makes it ideal for a variety of tasks, from general web browsing and office work to more detailed activities like graphic design and gaming.The mouse moves fluidly across different surfaces, and the buttons are responsive with a satisfying click. The scroll wheel also performs smoothly, offering just the right amount of resistance for controlled scrolling.Comfort and ErgonomicsComfort is a crucial factor for me, as I spend long hours working on the computer. The Lenovo 300 does not disappoint in this area. Its ergonomic shape fits comfortably in my hand, reducing strain during extended use. The mouse is suitable for both right and left-handed users, making it a versatile choice for a wide audience.DurabilityAfter a month of daily use, the Lenovo 300 shows no signs of wear and tear. The buttons and scroll wheel function as smoothly as they did on day one, and the overall build quality suggests it will be a durable addition to my tech arsenal.Value for MoneyConsidering its performance and build quality, the Lenovo 300 Wired USB Mouse offers excellent value for money. It is competitively priced on Amazon, making it an affordable option without compromising on quality.Pros and ConsPros:Easy plug-and-play setupHigh-resolution 1600 DPI optical sensor for precise controlComfortable and ergonomic designLightweight and durableSuitable for both right and left-handed usersExcellent value for moneyCons:Wired connection may not be preferred by those seeking wireless convenience;I've been using it for 2 years now. No issues faced. Comfortable. Won't recommend to hardcore gamers, but it's perfect for office or college use.;Mouse is really very good \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d.;Good quality, comfortable for office usage.;Good quality product;This mouse has a sleek and flat design compared to my old mouse. It took a few minutes to get used to it but now i prefer this mouse over my old bluetooth mouse. I switched to wired one because bluetooth mouse required changing batteries and the clicks were not as accurate or sometimes not responsive. Overall I'm happy with this product.;A very good, somewhat generic, simple, dependable wired mouse. I hate the wireless mice anymore. They never last very long for the price so I decided to buy several good quality wired mice instead. I have had very good luck with the Lenovo wired mouse and it usually lasts me several years before it quits.I'm very happy with this.;Llego r\u00e1pido y funciona muy bien.;Excelente mouse, bom tempo de resposta e boa usabilidade.;Did the job;\u0627\u0646\u0635\u062d \u0628\u0634\u0631\u0627\u0621\u0647",

The AMD Ryzen processor is strong enough for regular use at home.As opposed to what many mention, the laptop does come with a backlit keyboard.There is a pre-installed Microsoft Office also ready to use. Just have to create an account if you don't have one and login.;Okay review after 3 months ? 2 months ? Idk I forgot anyways, the laptop is bigger than you'd expect, slim, light, above average performance!Pros :Back-lit keyboardAccessibility is numerous,Ryzen Processor > IntelDisplay : LargeColour contrast : Vibrant Colour, FHDCharging takes less time !Value for money ? Big yes !(Better than Ausus, HP, sorry not sorry but all my families use different laptop that's much pricier than this laptop but it outperforms ausus vivobook, hp)Cons :\u2022 Not for heavy gaming as it drains quiet fast when you play games on it ( on 100% it drained quiet fast when I played DOTA)\u2022 Bluetooth tend to stop working when you're using a wireless mouse/keyboard and Bluetooth earbuds both connected to the laptop (you have to disconnect either the ear buds or the mouse)Camera : TRASH (Sorry not sorry)Conclusion: Dont play heavy games, good for academic works ( if you're not a developer don't stress on it but learn python at the least lol )Should you buy it ?Yes, if it's well within your budget(It's better than vivobook :D);I bought this Lenovo Ideapad laptop 3 months ago and after use of less than 2 months battery is not taking charge. I called the Amazon customer care they told me to contact Lenovo customer care for support. And when I called Lenovo customer care they checked the laptop virtually by taker controls from Rescue Lens application and found that there is a issue with battery. And after 3-4 days one of their technician come to replace the battery and after replacing the battery issue still remains same. Then he troubleshooted and told us that its motherboard having issues so they have to replace motherboard. I asked them to replace full unit but they are denying. I again called the customer care of lenovo but they are denying to replace the unit. Also, when I bought this unit I found that the warranty on site shows expired. I think these lenovo company guys are so unprofessional and there is no management and quality check of the products.  At last I want to say please dont buy this product its unreliable.....Its waste of money.;Works excellentHas all featuresBattery works for good 5-6 hours on continuous working and watching video.Very smooth and sleek.Value for money.;;It doesn't have backlit keyboard but the device performance is efficient. Loads windows under 10 secs and no log observed so far. The sound quality is really good.;Every thing is good but you can not control blacklit keyboard intensity light. You can just turn it on or off. You can't change it to low, medium and high. And fingerprint senseor is not compatible for the hello window is showing.Good pointsPerformance is goodBattery is goodBad pointsYou can't ajust the light of keyboard. But you can it on/offFingerprint senor is not working error is showing.;Really good product from Lenovo. Awesome backlit. Very good display.",

This one packs 84 keys in such a tiny package which is admirable saving huge space for compact workstation for gaming.3.Metal frame gives it a solid feel.4.The Keys feedback is linear  and tactile enough as preferred for Gaming5.Keys make very less sound even than a membrane keyboard .6.Priced competitively considering what its rival are offering.7.RGB is DOPE and has dedicated LADM software for RGB and Macro customization. Also supports Windows Dynamic lighting control.8.Without RGB it looks very professional and i had a very pleasant experience typing on work day.Cons:1.No extra switches inside the box.2.LADM is a bit buggy as per initial impressions.3.The Legends visibility may cause an issue to certain users who directly prefer typing at right angle as the keys are translucent offering very bright overexposing the letters which are printed in high quality.Overall a stunner from Lenovo!!!!GAME ON....;The media could not be loaded.Great clicking sounds, good build quality and amazing RGB effects.;Stopped working properly within a few weeks.;The keyboard disconnects automatically if your system remains idle for some time, and you have to reconnect the keyboard to use it again, which is quite annoying. This isn't a Mac issue because I was using a TVS mechanical keyboard earlier, and this never happened with that keyboard.;Comprei numa promo\u00e7\u00e3o e n\u00e3o me arrependi nem um pouco. \u00c9 a primeira vez que eu possuo um teclado f\u00edsico (utilizava antes apenas os padr\u00f5es dos notebooks) e essa experi\u00eancia est\u00e1 sendo uma maravilha. Mesmo possuindo padr\u00e3o internacional, vejo que n\u00e3o vai demorar muito pra eu me acostumar (estou escrevendo com ele nesse momento, com pouqu\u00edssimos erros.), o teclado praticamente n\u00e3o faz nenhum ru\u00eddo (pelo menos que incomode os outros), possui uma ilumina\u00e7\u00e3o agrad\u00e1vel (e com bastantes op\u00e7\u00f5es de customiza\u00e7\u00e3o)  e as teclas s\u00e3o bastante confort\u00e1veis. Mesmo sendo de membrana e de padr\u00e3o internacional n\u00e3o me arrependi (com uma entrega super r\u00e1pida, ali\u00e1s.), 100% recomendado.;Odio los teclados mec\u00e1nicos pero sigo queriendo teclados modernos, con membrana y luces y este es lo perfecto. Lo us\u00e9 durante 2 a\u00f1os y todav\u00eda funciona perfectamente. Las luces son perfectas en intensidad, no tenues ni demasiado potentes. Cubre todas las funciones necesarias para trabajar o jugar. Compr\u00e9 otro para otro escritorio.;Este teclado da Lenovo n\u00e3o deve em nada a um teclado mec\u00e2nico de pre\u00e7o similar! Comprei no escuro porque n\u00e3o havia reviews de brasileiros aqui no site, mas me surpreendi!Pontos positivos: teclado s\u00f3lido, d\u00e1 a impress\u00e3o de que a constru\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 bem feita; teclas muito macias; \u00e9 bonito e tamb\u00e9m a ilumina\u00e7\u00e3o RGB \u00e9 muito boa, permitindo-se enxergar as teclas no escuro facilmente; para jogos n\u00e3o encontrei nenhum problema.Ponto negativo: \u00e9 padr\u00e3o internacional, ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o tem a tecla cedilha por exemplo, ent\u00e3o para quem n\u00e3o est\u00e1 acostumado precisa reaprender.Enfim, teclado altamente recomendado!;Teclado muito bom, ru\u00eddo agrad\u00e1vel, que n\u00e3o atrapalha em nada al\u00e9m de ter o aplicativo da pr\u00f3pria Legion da Lenovo que da pra criar macros e escolher as cores do teclado! Recomendo!;Excelente!N\u00e3o esperava que seria t\u00e3o bom, o teclado \u00e9 de extrema qualidade e o RGB \u00e9 lindo!Bem constru\u00eddo, sem defeitos.O material \u00e9 muito bom, n\u00e3o \u00e9 aquele pl\u00e1stico gen\u00e9rico de teclados baratos, possui teclas macias e com uma textura que lembra algo emborrachado.\u00c9 bem pesado, pra mim n\u00e3o \u00e9 um problema, pois fica bem fixado na mesa.\u00c9 necess\u00e1rio um software para personalizar as cores, o software fica localizado no site da Lenovo.",

It also significantly reduces fingerprints, though it doesn\u2019t eliminate them entirely.Great Value for Money \u2013 Compared to other screen protectors I\u2019ve used, this one feels high-quality and well worth the purchase.I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a durable and well-packaged screen protector!;Nicely fitted to my Tab;Awesome product.

Overall, I am highly impressed by this pen and I just wish Lenovo had included it with my 7i, as I feel it is almost an essential aspect of the 2-in-1 experience. I would HIGHLY recommend without hesitation! It is DEFINITELY worth the money and extremely useful, convenient, & versatile, whether it's just for journaling, writing, drawing, or taking notes for school.

I agree it's not covering edge to edge, but that is for a reason so as to not to peel off or break when we put on the casing or any back cover.Next time, I would like to try 10.3 inch display screen guard on 10.1inch, so that it might cover edge to edge (hoping).Good product, go for it!;The clarity is top notch, applying was a easy task plus the quality is satisfactory.Initially some bubbles formed up which gave me a scare but they went after a day.Definitely go for this glass as it's the best in this price range.;Although it fits ok but a little bit a little tension on any side will make it crack, I just put it on and try to put the cover which was tight enough to hold the tab properly but the little push cracked the screen and also the air bubbles and big portion bubbles of air underneath the screen at coupleof places would never go away no matter howMuch you try.I have been using screen protectors on iPhone. iPad, tablets and android phones but never had this issue.

Please do not fall for any over the ear model that says it will keep your ears cool. That is not possible.But having said that above this product is the least warming. Yes. It warms up but the least. It has a really great meshy material for the padding, so it is light, it breathes through air and very soft.In my experience it can't be better for a usage that spans for hours.Sound quality is excellent for gaming and movies. Not going to explain Freq wise but it is great. Try it. I can assure you what the game or movie maker wanted you to hear, you will hear in best possible quality.It is not for music at all.For VoIP call, audio/ video calls this will be an overkill. You can buy a cheaper one.;Update: The headphone is delicate. It broke from middle within a year.I little bulky. But comfortable. Build Quality and sound is good. Not for heavy bass lovers. Mic is good, but noise cancellation is not that good. Can't expect much from this price.Overall a good buy.;Very sad to see such poor quality it's not even been a year and the headphone cracked.;Overall the headset is good but not sure about the noise cancellation part. Mic quality is good. Sound quality as well.;It\u2019s an simple one I\u2019m not much of noise cancellation but it does the job OK a bit on the heavy side and you will feel it once you remove it The volume is not up to the Mark as you can hear the background. Also the price is quite high for this type of headset should be from 1800-2200\u20b9;This headphone is mindblowing. If you can aford it you should but it. Its mic,speakers and body is awesome.Just a masterpiece from lenovo. Thought it could be more loud but actually as it is a gaming headphone so loudness need not be high its bass is good.This is a masterpiece if it is priced under Rs. 2100 (Though I have bought it for Rs. 1990). It costs more than 2200 or above no nee to buy it.;The tensile strength of the plastic part which holds the headphones together and provides elasticity is easily breakable. After a month of usage, the cracks have enlarged so the headphone no longer provides its grip on my head. The sound quality is excellent but i recommend to buy another model of headphone. The structural integrity of this model is highly questionable.;Using this for some casual gaming, has great sound quality and microphone makes coordination very easy. Been using it for work too!;I purchased these when they were marked down as a Christmas gift. They do not work and because the return policy, I\u2019m stuck with them.Don\u2019t buy them.;The Legion H200 headphones have exceeded all my expectations, delivering an exceptional audio experience and supreme comfort during extended use. As an avid music lover and gamer, finding the perfect pair of headphones has been a journey, but the Legion H200 has proven to be a true gem.The sound quality of these headphones is nothing short of impressive. The powerful bass, crisp mids, and clear highs provide an immersive and well-balanced audio experience, whether I'm lost in the world of a video game or enjoying my favorite tunes. The 50mm neodymium drivers ensure that every sound detail is captured, bringing games and music to life in a way I haven't experienced before.Comfort is another area where the Legion H200 excels. The plush memory foam ear cushions contour perfectly around my ears, providing a snug fit without any discomfort, even during marathon gaming sessions. The adjustable headband adds to the overall comfort, and I can wear these headphones for hours without any strain or fatigue.Build quality is top-notch, featuring a sturdy yet lightweight design. The metal frame and durable materials instill confidence in their longevity, making them suitable for both everyday use and travel. Additionally, the foldable design allows for easy storage when not in use.The microphone quality is excellent as well, offering clear and crisp communication with my teammates during intense multiplayer battles. The noise-cancelling feature ensures that background distractions are minimized, allowing for seamless team coordination.To top it all off, the Legion H200 comes at an incredibly competitive price point, making them a fantastic value for the level of performance they deliver.In conclusion, the Legion H200 headphones have truly impressed me with their outstanding sound quality, comfortable design, and durable build. Whether you're a gamer, a music enthusiast, or both, these headphones are an excellent choice that won't break the bank. I highly recommend the Legion H200 to anyone seeking a premium audio experience without compromising on comfort or affordability.;The product quality is as per expectations;My son loves them, total noise block out;Se escucha muy bien y el micro va bien, nunca he aguantado los cascos envolventes pero estos son muy c\u00f3modos. Inicialmente no me tra\u00eda el conector en Y, pero me han hecho un reemplazo que me lleg\u00f3 al d\u00eda siguiente. Muy contento con la compra.",

The AMD Ryzen processor is strong enough for regular use at home.As opposed to what many mention, the laptop does come with a backlit keyboard.There is a pre-installed Microsoft Office also ready to use. Just have to create an account if you don't have one and login.;Okay review after 3 months ? 2 months ? Idk I forgot anyways, the laptop is bigger than you'd expect, slim, light, above average performance!Pros :Back-lit keyboardAccessibility is numerous,Ryzen Processor > IntelDisplay : LargeColour contrast : Vibrant Colour, FHDCharging takes less time !Value for money ? Big yes !(Better than Ausus, HP, sorry not sorry but all my families use different laptop that's much pricier than this laptop but it outperforms ausus vivobook, hp)Cons :\u2022 Not for heavy gaming as it drains quiet fast when you play games on it ( on 100% it drained quiet fast when I played DOTA)\u2022 Bluetooth tend to stop working when you're using a wireless mouse/keyboard and Bluetooth earbuds both connected to the laptop (you have to disconnect either the ear buds or the mouse)Camera : TRASH (Sorry not sorry)Conclusion: Dont play heavy games, good for academic works ( if you're not a developer don't stress on it but learn python at the least lol )Should you buy it ?Yes, if it's well within your budget(It's better than vivobook :D);I bought this Lenovo Ideapad laptop 3 months ago and after use of less than 2 months battery is not taking charge. I called the Amazon customer care they told me to contact Lenovo customer care for support. And when I called Lenovo customer care they checked the laptop virtually by taker controls from Rescue Lens application and found that there is a issue with battery. And after 3-4 days one of their technician come to replace the battery and after replacing the battery issue still remains same. Then he troubleshooted and told us that its motherboard having issues so they have to replace motherboard. I asked them to replace full unit but they are denying. I again called the customer care of lenovo but they are denying to replace the unit. Also, when I bought this unit I found that the warranty on site shows expired. I think these lenovo company guys are so unprofessional and there is no management and quality check of the products.  At last I want to say please dont buy this product its unreliable.....Its waste of money.;Works excellentHas all featuresBattery works for good 5-6 hours on continuous working and watching video.Very smooth and sleek.Value for money.;;It doesn't have backlit keyboard but the device performance is efficient. Loads windows under 10 secs and no log observed so far. The sound quality is really good.;Every thing is good but you can not control blacklit keyboard intensity light. You can just turn it on or off. You can't change it to low, medium and high. And fingerprint senseor is not compatible for the hello window is showing.Good pointsPerformance is goodBattery is goodBad pointsYou can't ajust the light of keyboard. But you can it on/offFingerprint senor is not working error is showing.;Really good product from Lenovo. Awesome backlit. Very good display.",

The delivery was not very quick , almost a week.

But, gets heated up very fast.;Genuine Adaptor with USB (Box type) and ISI marked Power cord (Plug type D).The product is Genuine and manufactured for Lenovo but may not be identical to the adaptor which came along with the laptop as, either OEM's (Original Equipment Manufacturers) change over a period of time for companies or produce spare part adaptors with different appearance (like the stickering and plug types) for countries to be compliant towards their stringent Environmental standards/certification and Power Supply specifications.The product description by the seller is accurate.It is also the duty of the buyer to select the appropriate adaptor for the laptop in use.

But after a year the scroll wheel has given up. It's frustrating because rest of the buttons are working fine.The mouse is big, not suitable for small hands at all.;I recently switched to a new mouse not because of any issues with this mouse but just because my cord was bitten by my cat, but despite that this mouse worked without any issues and it still works.AMAZING MOUSE;It's good for casual gaming and the customisable buttons really are useful..but cannot be used in gamesRGB can be turned off to go for a subtle, work lookDownside, cable is long but not braided gets torn off easily just like the Apple cables\ud83d\ude02Update after 1 Year of using:Prolonged usage causes mouse to misbehave and not work as intendedThe side buttons are hard to press and they feel like they are about to fall off soonThere is a slight delay even with 1000Hz polling;The mouse is fantastic for the price. It can be compared to the entry level logitech mouse easily. The thing i like the most about this mouse is its weight, its probably one of the lightest in this range. The wire quality is fine, the customisation from the Legion software is okay, the max of 1000hz polling rate makes it very responsive and excellent for gaming considering the cost.The design though is pretty basic and not one of those flashy mice where RGBs are everywhere. It just has a single customisable RGB on the legion logo. I feel the design is decent.;The media could not be loaded.The box that the mouse arrived in was little battered, but the mouse was not damaged at all.I love the mouse, looks spectacular.Pros - 1. Lightweight2. Ergonomic3. RGB is customizable4. Software support5. Mouse feet is really smoothCons - 1. The clicks are little soft and mushy2. Scroll wheel is tight3. Wire is not braided typeFor the price of 980rs, that I paid.

I choose this Lenovo mouse because of Lenovo's reputation for designing and manufacturing quality products. This mouse is ambidextrous and as a left-handed person I greatly appreciate this feature. The colour is a bit unusual, what Lenovo calls Abyss Blue. Great desktop colour. The mouse is a classic, simple design. It is full-sized and sits well in the hand. I am not able to vouch for its durability. The Lenovo keyboard I also just purchased (again, to replace a poorly-designed and manufactured Logitech product) is rated at 10 million keystrokes!

Worth the money.;Excellent Noise cancellation (cancelling sounds like mixer grinder, kids playing, some one speaking in couple of feets away, construction work noises, etc)No ear pain while using long hrs, i'm continuously using more than 6hrs in a day.Cushion is very soft which does not affect the earsSound quality is Good, I'm using this headphone only for calls so it's good for me.Value for money!!!!;It echoes to others when we are not talking.;Basic product with at an expensive price. The touch and feel is good. After paying 3K plus it is not upto the mark with sound quality (Base and surround response). Also it does not have a volume controller and mute/unmute featurs. With Lesser price more attractive alternatives are available. I chose this product because of the brand value. The quality and features are not justified with the price tag. Please re-think.;I remember, I used this for 2 years. I used it for my job for 2 years, and the experience was really really good. From my side, it's the best product. Go for it, guys.;Pros:- Very light on the head which makes it suitable for long hours of continuous office calls.- Voice quality is crystal clear.Cons:- Ear lobes pain when used for long time.- Noise cancellation is moderate.- Slight cracking intermittently while recording with microphone, though nobody complaints that voice cannot be heard.All in all, pretty good for the price and suitable for office use. Other headphones I looked for are either too heavy on the head or way too expensive.;In this price range this is one of the best headset according to my concern. I am using this for last 2 months for office work (like Microsoft Team, Group discussion etc.) and also sometimes I am listening song with this headset and the quality of sound is good. If you are searching a headset for office work in the range of 2k then go for it, also build quality is very good.;These earphones lasted me over two years!  I just repurchased and the sound quality is awesome!;The sound isn't clear and the mic is very bad;Sound very clear.  Fits for purpose. Convenient on ears.;Super quality, very soft feeling, perfect sound effects. Mid size, perfect fit to ears, not big not small. Great choice for online meetings. I have to say that this is even better than my expectation.;They are nice. Too hot for me. And too close on the ear. You can't be as Alert with these. Maybe good for working out.I want to return them. They were a gift for my birthday.",

Size and weight is not too much. All together it is value for money.;The media could not be loaded.Using it for a month and a halfPros:16gb ram is a wise choice for a coder.Screen Quality is good (Don't know why there were a lot of negative reviews about it), Genuine Windows 11 and MS office (great for students and content creators),Lightweight, easy and fast.Drawbacks:audio could have been better ( I use earphones and speaker so not an issue for me).definitely not a gaming laptop even if it advertises as such (xbox 3 month pass and I couldn't use it because video memory is lower than my previous lap)no backlit keyboard (it's not available in any IdeaPad slim 1)the metal body easily gets scratched and chipped (my advise is buy laptop bag or skin immediately, even a week is too late)Comment: first time ryzen user and gotta say it's good for everything outside gaming. Students and soft computer users can definitely go for this. If you're a gamer I would advise i5 and something with a graphic card. 16gb ram is better if you use a lot of softwares.;It's a good laptop for routine work not involving much graphics. Quality of body could have been better. Speaker audio is just about adequate. Worth the money paid;I received prodcut with defective speaker, sound quality is poor even at 100% volume. When I reached out to customer care they promised technician visit which did not happen, after called them again, I was promised return of the prodcut and refund to original payment. After multiple attempts, return was not picked up and refund was not provided. Amazon customer care told me, they started investigation why carrier did not pick-up and asked me wait for couple of days for resolution.  When I called after 3 days, I was told, everything is good on their side and they can not provide refund and won't be taking return as well.  This is daylight cheating and fradualent activity.  Customer care agent will provide template response and there is no esclation matrix for grievences.  I'm going to consumer court for on this matter.;Purchased this laptop to connect to office Citrix desktop and do work from home. Great speed and easy connectivity. I use my headset for audio and separate webcam for video calls so not tested the inbuilt webcam and speaker but should be pretty good. Worth the money and purchase.;Speed-5 starLooks-5 starCons- very less Usb ports and no LAN portOverall best choice.;The media could not be loaded.My personal review:1.Performance(Ram-16gb)Laptop runs smoothly even when you are multitasking and handles multiple tab opening easily.If you are not a heavy gamer ( you can play casual gaming easily  as well) but insteadwant a laptop for daily or office use, you will surely like this laptop.2. DisplayThe display is more than clear enough to watch movies or any content( obviously some would argue Oled display is better;but they come at a higher price as well).3.BatteryBattery lasts for around 3 hrs on a continuous usage( battery life could be better , but it's still ok at the price range)4.SoundSound quality is also good and clear .Sound loudness is more than enough , in my above video, the music video is being played at 56 volume which itself is loud enough for me.5.HeatingPersonally , not a heavy gamer , so heating has not been an issue for me.Final Review -If you never had a laptop and is thinking of getting this laptop, go for it , you won't get a better laptop at this price range.;In my point of this laptop is very very good because of its sound,screen,keyboard,and branding it has only one thing that is not good is it has not backlit if you think in photo it screen is not good but no my phone camera quality is not good if you think you will buy this laptop then you must and over all this laptop is so good and also have 65W charger",

Awesome screen and looks premium. The keyboard is good. Got it for 48k in sale. The power back up is very poor which is only disadvantage I observed. The sound is very low. Many people complained MOBO. Will update after few weeksAfter a week of use, I loved everything about this laptop. Found no problem. Using this mostly for office work and entertainment. In batter save mode got 3.5hrs. in normal mode, hardly getting 1.5 to 2 hrs. In rapid charging mode, charged fully within 1 hr, which is quite good for me. Main drawbacks are sound, which is very low even in full volume, not good for people who watches movies and stuff in laptop. The camera quality is below par, totally disappointed with camera.;Battery drain is the only issue. Rest it is a fantastic laptop with premium build.;Here I bought 512GB SSD and when laptop is delivered it has 474GB SSD;I was quietly impressed with this LOQ series..Holding the box for first time doesn't feels like a gaming laptop \ud83d\udcbb . Having such a powerful processor and graphics card the weight of laptop is really nice . I played Gta 5 for around 1 2 hours in this case the laptop doesn't heat to much and also fan noise are not to loud. Lenevo really making this series looks like legion . Appreciate it lenevo.;Does everything you expect of it. Very sturdy and smooth.Battery life is slightly disappointing though, lasts 3-4 hours of using things like Word and PowerPoint as well, which is not ideal, but considering the hardware, somewhat expected. To be fair Lenovo has mentioned that on a packaging film beforehand itself.Does not have pre-installed activated MS Office, has to be bought separately (the Lenovo website version says that it has it).Otherwise pretty good.;The laptop is as good as I thought. No issues, no problem. I am an occasional gamer, so for me, it's good. And video editing is smooth.I don't know why people complaint about sound, the sound is satisfactory.The display is top notch and battery life is also good (approx 4 hrs on 100% charge). Makes no noise. Built quality is royal.Loved it.;It is a mid range laptop ,sound quality is superb, but its comes with low volume .Display:It comes with 300nits .Its excellent experience gives to user.Keyboard keys: very good key travel is superb,respond time also good.Track pad: very smooth response is good.Web cam :it is comes with 720p quality.Overall rating : I give 4out of 5 .",

                "text": "The media could not be loaded.Reviewing  after 1 month of usages!! First I'm confused about this laptop because of the negative review ,it's a great laptop for basic use & for professionals.Pros--The build quality is good \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb,- the design is very sleek smooth- keyboard quality and keys are good, \u263a\ufe0f-Processor is beast very much satisfied ,-Battery life is also average max 4 hr to 5 hr depends on usages ,- lenovo service is so good I can say cause I noticed that my touchpad is sometimes lagging(coz of BIOS not uptodate) so I connect with the support team in lenovo offical website , he fixed it in just 10 mins! \u263a\ufe0fCONS-  Brightness is bit low have to set in 80 to100 range- speaker sound is average!- while charging the heating issue felt but not very much- only 60hrz refresh rate not satisfied- sometimes  display wombling not much but little- backlit light is  dim.Overall it'a good laptop \u2665\ufe0f 4.5/5If your priority is  not gaming or editingthen you can go for it! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb;Almost using it for 5 days :-Pros :- \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d.) Build quality\ud83d\udca5.) Display worth the money.) Battery life - I got 7.5 hrs with normal usage ( offline movies + YouTube + Browsing + Pdf reading) with Wifi and Bluetooth turned on all the time...I kept brightness at 30% ( since It is sufficient for me in indoors ) and in dark mode...Another time I got only 5.5 hrs of battery life...so not sure of the exact battery span..) Flip to start is very useful.) Booting time is only 10-15 secs max.) Performance is good for this budget.) Light weight and very convenient to use especially for studyingCons :- \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e.) Heating issue while charging\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8.) Sometimes it heats up even with normal usage.) Speaker is good but sound is low.) Missing fingerprint sensor/Facial recognition in this rangeTips :-.) Don't charge immediately after using for more hours...let the heat to cool down and then charge.) After charging let the heat to cool down..then start to use ( will Increase battery span )Product got delivered b4 the due date...and packaging was good \ud83d\udc4dConclusion : Simply go for it if you are a student and doesn't play that much of games\ud83d\udca5;Lightweight, good quality, high performance, good battery life and fast charging. I brought before 4 months and used for high performance programming. Over all its worth buying and truly made for developers.;I bought this laptop few days back. There was an issue with the screen so I had to return/replace it. The amazon guys has been lying from start. They said they were going to initiate a lenovo technician visit. I waited for 2 days, no one came so I called lenovo directly. They said they had no notification regarding any booking of technician visit.Once I booked the technician visit in lenovo's side a visit was arranged. In the meantime amazon kept telling me that their hands are tied as long as the product is not sealed by lenovo. Once lenoco technician checks the project and gives no objection for return we will return/replace it immediately. Now it has been almost 2 weeks, everyday a return is created and gets cancelled saying the product was not ready when actually no one visited.My biggest mistake was to buy it from amazon. The laptop is actually good. But directly from lenovo or may ve croma.;It's very slim , The build is plastic but it's very tough , the display is FHD and it's a good display, The processer is actually a beast but you need to use it on charging to utilise it's full capacity , battery backup despite of having a H series processor and 48W Battery it performs very well and give you a 5hr screen on time the sound isn't too loud but if you keep it on your lap or so then you won't face any issue , And the main keypoint of this laptop is it's i7 13gen processor which is very very powerful but remember it has a intel UHD graphics so you are not going to play any graphics involving games it won't be a smooth experience overall a good product for real;Great product. Got it for 43k so a sweet purchase.Few cons:No Type-C Charging \u2013 This is the biggest letdown.No Fingerprint Sensor \u2013 At this price point (60k), it's a noticeable omission.Can't Be Opened with One Hand \u2013 Not a dealbreaker, but it would have been a nice touch.Lid Feels a Bit Fragile \u2013 Possibly due to being too tight, making the lid feel delicate when opening.;Within 15 hours I got product after ordered, product build quality is very poor. You will not feel satisfaction after 56K spend. Other body quality is very poor and all core are sharp.Performance wise good because very hi fi processor and RAM.I will not recommend if you searching good and attractive body quality and  robust Laptop.;Have been using this for more than a month now.Everything about this laptop is perfect, The processor combines high power efficiency along with great performance, giving this laptop a good battery backup.16 GB ram is adequate and it can handle multitasking very well. The laptop starts up very quickly thanks to the SSD used.Design and finishing is perfect. Would recommend this to others.",

Size and weight is not too much. All together it is value for money.;The media could not be loaded.Using it for a month and a halfPros:16gb ram is a wise choice for a coder.Screen Quality is good (Don't know why there were a lot of negative reviews about it), Genuine Windows 11 and MS office (great for students and content creators),Lightweight, easy and fast.Drawbacks:audio could have been better ( I use earphones and speaker so not an issue for me).definitely not a gaming laptop even if it advertises as such (xbox 3 month pass and I couldn't use it because video memory is lower than my previous lap)no backlit keyboard (it's not available in any IdeaPad slim 1)the metal body easily gets scratched and chipped (my advise is buy laptop bag or skin immediately, even a week is too late)Comment: first time ryzen user and gotta say it's good for everything outside gaming. Students and soft computer users can definitely go for this. If you're a gamer I would advise i5 and something with a graphic card. 16gb ram is better if you use a lot of softwares.;It's a good laptop for routine work not involving much graphics. Quality of body could have been better. Speaker audio is just about adequate. Worth the money paid;I received prodcut with defective speaker, sound quality is poor even at 100% volume. When I reached out to customer care they promised technician visit which did not happen, after called them again, I was promised return of the prodcut and refund to original payment. After multiple attempts, return was not picked up and refund was not provided. Amazon customer care told me, they started investigation why carrier did not pick-up and asked me wait for couple of days for resolution.  When I called after 3 days, I was told, everything is good on their side and they can not provide refund and won't be taking return as well.  This is daylight cheating and fradualent activity.  Customer care agent will provide template response and there is no esclation matrix for grievences.  I'm going to consumer court for on this matter.;Purchased this laptop to connect to office Citrix desktop and do work from home. Great speed and easy connectivity. I use my headset for audio and separate webcam for video calls so not tested the inbuilt webcam and speaker but should be pretty good. Worth the money and purchase.;Speed-5 starLooks-5 starCons- very less Usb ports and no LAN portOverall best choice.;The media could not be loaded.My personal review:1.Performance(Ram-16gb)Laptop runs smoothly even when you are multitasking and handles multiple tab opening easily.If you are not a heavy gamer ( you can play casual gaming easily  as well) but insteadwant a laptop for daily or office use, you will surely like this laptop.2. DisplayThe display is more than clear enough to watch movies or any content( obviously some would argue Oled display is better;but they come at a higher price as well).3.BatteryBattery lasts for around 3 hrs on a continuous usage( battery life could be better , but it's still ok at the price range)4.SoundSound quality is also good and clear .Sound loudness is more than enough , in my above video, the music video is being played at 56 volume which itself is loud enough for me.5.HeatingPersonally , not a heavy gamer , so heating has not been an issue for me.Final Review -If you never had a laptop and is thinking of getting this laptop, go for it , you won't get a better laptop at this price range.;In my point of this laptop is very very good because of its sound,screen,keyboard,and branding it has only one thing that is not good is it has not backlit if you think in photo it screen is not good but no my phone camera quality is not good if you think you will buy this laptop then you must and over all this laptop is so good and also have 65W charger",

                "text": "It is best in the price range.Pros :1. Very nice quality and worked better than expected in both well lighted and less lighted areas.2. Your image won't be blurry.3. Mic quality is very good.Cons :1. The cover for camera allows some light to pass through the edges which will be noticeable in video.2. Covers too much background area , this webcam camera works like wide angle camera.3. I said it has vey good mic but it's one drawback is that it will catch noise of someone talking in other room or a thing falling outside the room.I will suggest you to buy this webcam as it's quality better than logitech c270 webcam and others in this range .;The quality is top notch for a fair price. Great product if you laptop doesn't have a camera.;I had earlier bought Logitech Brio 100 - it had pathetic field of view (FOV) of 58\u00b0 making your face fully fill the screen at typical laptop distance / seems it is more suitable when using a large monitor placed farther away from your face. This Lenovo webcam is perfect with 90\u00b0 FOV - and this matches typical laptop integrated webcams. The resolution is good and image quality is top notch - crystal clear and sharp. Defiantly recommend this to anyone looking to use a webcam to be placed on top of the laptop screen.;Its only 2 mega pixel but quality is far far better than the inbuilt camera in majority of the laptops. Wide view with immediate responsiveness. The picture/vid quality is 3.5/5 in Windows 10 default app but improves significantly with 3rd party software. Wire is very long...its way more than sufficient. Build quality is awesome, with a slider to cover the camera which is useful in case camera switches on during a conference call without our knowledge. Two mics are amazing as they deliver crystal clear input...sound in video recording is crystal clear...wow...bought it for online classes...got 400 discount and cashback...highly recommend.;Easy to connect and use but picture and video quality has not met my expectation.;Web cam work but not Microphone. Google meet have both mic and cam access but mic doesn\u2019t work. I wish , I could have figured out this early to return it before return window closed. Now I am stuck with this junk. I purchased this for tv only :(Would not recommend this to use this cam in any android tv.;Pros1. Plug and play2. Cheap3. Acceptable Picture quality under proper lighting4. Privacy shutter5. Super light. Fits on the top of the monitorCons:1. Too wide angle. Your entire room will be visible2. No Lenovo custom software to control the zoom/quality. Not sure how to achieve 4X digital zoom mentioned. You can use OBS Studio (PC and Mac) or Nvidia GeForce broadcast (in PC) to achieve this though. Or, you can buy a tripod and keep it close to your face3. No USB C adapter provided (For Mac users)4. Audio is bad if used from a distance. Using a separate mic is recommended5. For low light, lots of image grain is visibleAt this price, this is recommended for attending classes/meetings. May work for streaming if the lighting is right.;Good quality camera with decent resolution in low light too. Was sceptical due to lower price, but it's really worth it to buy. Bought this for my TV with Jio settop box which supports camera for video calling using Jio Join app;Muito boa e bem constru\u00edda, cores bem forte qualidade de imagem e resolu\u00e7\u00e3o muito boa, tem um \u00e2ngulo de vis\u00e3o bem grande;When Logitech failed to come out with a Win 11 driver for my high-end Logitech Webcam Pro I felt abandoned by them. Luckily at the same time I was still fuming over them basically abandoning their customers, I own multiple Logitech wired and wireless trackball products for many years, I received an email from Tom's Hardware recommending this Lenovo unit. At 66% less than anything around it with _equivalent_ specs and quality, I jumped on it here on Amazon and I am TOTALLY PLEASED.A bonus is that is also have a sliding panel on the face of it that covers the camera lens. The sound, video quality, and software are all first class. I would highly recommend this to anyone.;After my built in camera on my laptop failed and numerous attempts to fix the problem I gave in and decided the easiest course of action would be a plug and play.The Lenovo was a recommended buy on Consumers Reports so went with a throughly rated product.  Literally a plug and play, with no software to download. I have no issue using on Zoom or MS Teams meeting.Good quality video and excellent sound.;Unbesch\u00e4digt top zustand;Great camera. Quality to price is 10/10.",

                "text": "I recently purchased the Dell 15 Thin & Light Laptop, and so far, I'm quite impressed. It packs a Core i5-1235U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, which makes multitasking smooth and quick. The 15.6\" FHD display is sharp and offers great visuals whether I'm streaming videos or working on documents.What stands out for me is how lightweight it is\u2014just 1.66kg\u2014making it super portable without feeling flimsy. Despite its slim design, the laptop feels sturdy, and the spill-resistant keyboard is a nice touch for added peace of mind.Another bonus is the pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office 2021, so I was ready to work right out of the box. The inclusion of 15 months of McAfee security is a nice plus, especially if you're cautious about online threats.If I had to nitpick, 8GB of RAM is decent for everyday tasks but may not be enough for more intensive work or gaming. Also, the build, while durable, does attract fingerprints, especially on the black finish.Overall, this is an excellent laptop for students, professionals, or anyone needing a reliable machine for daily use without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for its performance, portability, and value!;As soon as the 1year warranty period is over the laptop stopped working. It gets hanged or dropped out when I'm in a meeting. Also it gets hanged when I'm trying to open an excell or any file. I've been trying to reach the customer support as well but they don't take you call or respond to message. Worst customer service and worst product. Please don't buy it.;;Worth buying this, thx.;Fear that...it may blast;nice;I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare. Right out of the box, there was a glaring green dot on the screen that refuses to go away, and the camera is unstable, making it impossible to use for work or meetings.I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to help. When I contacted Dell, their so-called \"support\" team told me they could only replace the LED/ED screen and couldn\u2019t even provide me with a DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter. How does that even make sense for a brand-new product?I trusted Amazon and Dell to deliver a quality product and back it up with proper service, but I\u2019ve been left stuck in the middle with no solution. Both companies are shirking their responsibilities, and now I\u2019m stuck with a defective laptop.This is unacceptable from two major companies that are supposed to be industry leaders. I will think twice before purchasing anything from Amazon or Dell again. Buyers beware! Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.;light weight, good portability, decent looks , good built quality, battery lasts 5-6 hrs for normal use , lasts 8 hrs on battery saver mode if you do light works .  All well except one  issue that is it starts lagging /stuttering, videos get hung if you use the laptop while charging due to overheating . But this problem is solved by using better cooling solution like using laptop bottom riser while charging. Dont forget to buy a laptop riser along with this product.",

I even contacted the seller to thank him as it looks completely new. I have used it continuously for hours and there had been no heating issues as well. This is perfect for my streams.;The media could not be loaded.I am extremely disappointed with this product. The primary reason I purchased this webcam was for the advertised privacy shutter. Upon receiving the product, I found that the privacy shutter was completely absent. This is a clear case of false advertising and a significant security breach.The lack of a privacy shutter renders the product useless for its intended purpose. I expected a product that prioritized user privacy, but instead, I received a product that compromised it.I demand a full refund and a replacement product with the advertised privacy shutter. This is unacceptable and a complete waste of my time and money.;Good;Everything related to this webcam is great. The only downside is with the wide angle.

I have not claimed it yet, but I hope they will resolve the issue promptly.;Hi,I was under the impression that I was purchasing the actual Lenovo extended warranty. Since the Lenovo logo used and images as well. But this's from Servify and you can easily miss this, because Lenovo logo and details used almost everywhere.If they deceive customers like this at the beginning, not sure what will they do when you approach them for actual assistance. Only time will tell.To have a peace of mind, buy from Lenovo directly. It's less only. Screenshot attached",

My only issue is that it doesn't have a small indicator light near the scroll button to show if it's on or off.

When the battery is low, the light may turn off, but you can still use the mouse for a few more days. Once you replace the battery, it should work fine. If you use an LR6 battery (e.g., Eveready Ultima or Duracell Ultra), it can last 4-5 months with daily use, or even longer with lighter usage.;very useful & confortable;It's been more than a year, but the mouse still works great.

                "text": "The media could not be loaded.Too much RGB for the Brain to Process!!!Pros:1.Lenovo Brand quality with 3 years of warranty which is exceptional value for money for a mid range mechanical Gaming Keyboard.2.Extremely compact compared to other TKL keyboards which just provide 3 extra keys. This one packs 84 keys in such a tiny package which is admirable saving huge space for compact workstation for gaming.3.Metal frame gives it a solid feel.4.The Keys feedback is linear  and tactile enough as preferred for Gaming5.Keys make very less sound even than a membrane keyboard .6.Priced competitively considering what its rival are offering.7.RGB is DOPE and has dedicated LADM software for RGB and Macro customization. Also supports Windows Dynamic lighting control.8.Without RGB it looks very professional and i had a very pleasant experience typing on work day.Cons:1.No extra switches inside the box.2.LADM is a bit buggy as per initial impressions.3.The Legends visibility may cause an issue to certain users who directly prefer typing at right angle as the keys are translucent offering very bright overexposing the letters which are printed in high quality.Overall a stunner from Lenovo!!!!GAME ON....;The media could not be loaded.Great clicking sounds, good build quality and amazing RGB effects.;Stopped working properly within a few weeks.;The keyboard disconnects automatically if your system remains idle for some time, and you have to reconnect the keyboard to use it again, which is quite annoying. This isn't a Mac issue because I was using a TVS mechanical keyboard earlier, and this never happened with that keyboard.;Comprei numa promo\u00e7\u00e3o e n\u00e3o me arrependi nem um pouco. \u00c9 a primeira vez que eu possuo um teclado f\u00edsico (utilizava antes apenas os padr\u00f5es dos notebooks) e essa experi\u00eancia est\u00e1 sendo uma maravilha. Mesmo possuindo padr\u00e3o internacional, vejo que n\u00e3o vai demorar muito pra eu me acostumar (estou escrevendo com ele nesse momento, com pouqu\u00edssimos erros.), o teclado praticamente n\u00e3o faz nenhum ru\u00eddo (pelo menos que incomode os outros), possui uma ilumina\u00e7\u00e3o agrad\u00e1vel (e com bastantes op\u00e7\u00f5es de customiza\u00e7\u00e3o)  e as teclas s\u00e3o bastante confort\u00e1veis. Mesmo sendo de membrana e de padr\u00e3o internacional n\u00e3o me arrependi (com uma entrega super r\u00e1pida, ali\u00e1s.), 100% recomendado.;Odio los teclados mec\u00e1nicos pero sigo queriendo teclados modernos, con membrana y luces y este es lo perfecto. Lo us\u00e9 durante 2 a\u00f1os y todav\u00eda funciona perfectamente. Las luces son perfectas en intensidad, no tenues ni demasiado potentes. Cubre todas las funciones necesarias para trabajar o jugar. Compr\u00e9 otro para otro escritorio.;Este teclado da Lenovo n\u00e3o deve em nada a um teclado mec\u00e2nico de pre\u00e7o similar! Comprei no escuro porque n\u00e3o havia reviews de brasileiros aqui no site, mas me surpreendi!Pontos positivos: teclado s\u00f3lido, d\u00e1 a impress\u00e3o de que a constru\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 bem feita; teclas muito macias; \u00e9 bonito e tamb\u00e9m a ilumina\u00e7\u00e3o RGB \u00e9 muito boa, permitindo-se enxergar as teclas no escuro facilmente; para jogos n\u00e3o encontrei nenhum problema.Ponto negativo: \u00e9 padr\u00e3o internacional, ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o tem a tecla cedilha por exemplo, ent\u00e3o para quem n\u00e3o est\u00e1 acostumado precisa reaprender.Enfim, teclado altamente recomendado!;Teclado muito bom, ru\u00eddo agrad\u00e1vel, que n\u00e3o atrapalha em nada al\u00e9m de ter o aplicativo da pr\u00f3pria Legion da Lenovo que da pra criar macros e escolher as cores do teclado! Recomendo!;Excelente!N\u00e3o esperava que seria t\u00e3o bom, o teclado \u00e9 de extrema qualidade e o RGB \u00e9 lindo!Bem constru\u00eddo, sem defeitos.O material \u00e9 muito bom, n\u00e3o \u00e9 aquele pl\u00e1stico gen\u00e9rico de teclados baratos, possui teclas macias e com uma textura que lembra algo emborrachado.\u00c9 bem pesado, pra mim n\u00e3o \u00e9 um problema, pois fica bem fixado na mesa.\u00c9 necess\u00e1rio um software para personalizar as cores, o software fica localizado no site da Lenovo.",

Looks good2. Smoth gliding in surface3. Ergo is good, not suitable for small or medium Hand4. You can configure using the software, no inbuilt memory to carry your setting.5. It'll take some time to get to used to.6. Lightweight.7. Dynamic Scroll works well;This is a silent mouse, with two additional buttons. no dongle included, just switch on and use. can connect to two devices at a time. The scroll wheel does not have the side scrolling operation. Looks good. No need to change battery, just charge and use. Weight is comfortable to use.;Smooth in use with good experience.;Bought it directly from Lenovo store and used it for 2 months now. It\u2019s awesome product very smooth and can connect to multiple devices and no clicking sound is a boon. However, the portion below the right thumb (am right handed) starts paining after 1-2 hours of use and this has become a problem for me. The slight bump in the mouse design causes this and could be a specific issue in my case. I have switched back to a normal mouse and am still looking for a solution.;Product information is not matching with Lenovo website. Lenovo website saying warranty is one year, but Amazon saying warranty would be three years. That\u2019s what the conflict I have, apart from that product is good.;Vale i soldi spesi.;Alles, Bestellung, Zustellung, Qualit\u00e4t hat super gut geklappt.

With this addition, I now have a Lenovo PC, Lenovo webcam and a Lenovo headphone. I am happy with the trio - all purchased from Amazon.;The quality is good. Color looks amazing. My colleagues have also asked and I've shared the review with them as well. Sound quality is crisp. Ofcourse doesn't have noise cancellation and mute/volume controls etc on its own. Worth the money.;Excellent Noise cancellation (cancelling sounds like mixer grinder, kids playing, some one speaking in couple of feets away, construction work noises, etc)No ear pain while using long hrs, i'm continuously using more than 6hrs in a day.Cushion is very soft which does not affect the earsSound quality is Good, I'm using this headphone only for calls so it's good for me.Value for money!!!!;It echoes to others when we are not talking.;Basic product with at an expensive price. The touch and feel is good. After paying 3K plus it is not upto the mark with sound quality (Base and surround response). Also it does not have a volume controller and mute/unmute featurs. With Lesser price more attractive alternatives are available. I chose this product because of the brand value. The quality and features are not justified with the price tag. Please re-think.;I remember, I used this for 2 years. I used it for my job for 2 years, and the experience was really really good. From my side, it's the best product. Go for it, guys.;Pros:- Very light on the head which makes it suitable for long hours of continuous office calls.- Voice quality is crystal clear.Cons:- Ear lobes pain when used for long time.- Noise cancellation is moderate.- Slight cracking intermittently while recording with microphone, though nobody complaints that voice cannot be heard.All in all, pretty good for the price and suitable for office use. Other headphones I looked for are either too heavy on the head or way too expensive.;In this price range this is one of the best headset according to my concern. I am using this for last 2 months for office work (like Microsoft Team, Group discussion etc.) and also sometimes I am listening song with this headset and the quality of sound is good. If you are searching a headset for office work in the range of 2k then go for it, also build quality is very good.;These earphones lasted me over two years!  I just repurchased and the sound quality is awesome!;The sound isn't clear and the mic is very bad;Sound very clear.  Fits for purpose. Convenient on ears.;Super quality, very soft feeling, perfect sound effects. Mid size, perfect fit to ears, not big not small. Great choice for online meetings. I have to say that this is even better than my expectation.;They are nice. Too hot for me. And too close on the ear. You can't be as Alert with these. Maybe good for working out.I want to return them. They were a gift for my birthday.",

Size and weight is not too much. All together it is value for money.;The media could not be loaded.Using it for a month and a halfPros:16gb ram is a wise choice for a coder.Screen Quality is good (Don't know why there were a lot of negative reviews about it), Genuine Windows 11 and MS office (great for students and content creators),Lightweight, easy and fast.Drawbacks:audio could have been better ( I use earphones and speaker so not an issue for me).definitely not a gaming laptop even if it advertises as such (xbox 3 month pass and I couldn't use it because video memory is lower than my previous lap)no backlit keyboard (it's not available in any IdeaPad slim 1)the metal body easily gets scratched and chipped (my advise is buy laptop bag or skin immediately, even a week is too late)Comment: first time ryzen user and gotta say it's good for everything outside gaming. Students and soft computer users can definitely go for this. If you're a gamer I would advise i5 and something with a graphic card. 16gb ram is better if you use a lot of softwares.;It's a good laptop for routine work not involving much graphics. Quality of body could have been better. Speaker audio is just about adequate. Worth the money paid;I received prodcut with defective speaker, sound quality is poor even at 100% volume. When I reached out to customer care they promised technician visit which did not happen, after called them again, I was promised return of the prodcut and refund to original payment. After multiple attempts, return was not picked up and refund was not provided. Amazon customer care told me, they started investigation why carrier did not pick-up and asked me wait for couple of days for resolution.  When I called after 3 days, I was told, everything is good on their side and they can not provide refund and won't be taking return as well.  This is daylight cheating and fradualent activity.  Customer care agent will provide template response and there is no esclation matrix for grievences.  I'm going to consumer court for on this matter.;Purchased this laptop to connect to office Citrix desktop and do work from home. Great speed and easy connectivity. I use my headset for audio and separate webcam for video calls so not tested the inbuilt webcam and speaker but should be pretty good. Worth the money and purchase.;Speed-5 starLooks-5 starCons- very less Usb ports and no LAN portOverall best choice.;The media could not be loaded.My personal review:1.Performance(Ram-16gb)Laptop runs smoothly even when you are multitasking and handles multiple tab opening easily.If you are not a heavy gamer ( you can play casual gaming easily  as well) but insteadwant a laptop for daily or office use, you will surely like this laptop.2. DisplayThe display is more than clear enough to watch movies or any content( obviously some would argue Oled display is better;but they come at a higher price as well).3.BatteryBattery lasts for around 3 hrs on a continuous usage( battery life could be better , but it's still ok at the price range)4.SoundSound quality is also good and clear .Sound loudness is more than enough , in my above video, the music video is being played at 56 volume which itself is loud enough for me.5.HeatingPersonally , not a heavy gamer , so heating has not been an issue for me.Final Review -If you never had a laptop and is thinking of getting this laptop, go for it , you won't get a better laptop at this price range.;In my point of this laptop is very very good because of its sound,screen,keyboard,and branding it has only one thing that is not good is it has not backlit if you think in photo it screen is not good but no my phone camera quality is not good if you think you will buy this laptop then you must and over all this laptop is so good and also have 65W charger",

Equipped with an Intel i5-12500H processor, 16GB DDR5 RAM, and a 512GB SSD, this laptop delivers an ultimate gaming experience. The NVIDIA RTX 3050 (4GB GDDR6) graphics card ensures smooth and immersive gameplay, making every session a visual treat.The 15.6\" FHD WVA AG 120Hz display with 250 nits of brightness provides superb screen quality, perfect for both gaming and multimedia consumption. The vibrant colors and sharp details enhance the overall visual experience. The backlit keyboard with an orange hue adds a stylish touch, making it a pleasure to use even in low-light conditions.Despite its many strengths, the laptop does have one notable drawback\u2014the battery life. Given its substantial weight and heavy-duty battery, I expected it to last at least three hours on a single charge. However, I was disappointed to find that the battery life only allows for about half an hour of gaming. This short battery life can be a significant inconvenience, especially for gamers who enjoy long sessions without being tethered to a power outlet.Aside from the battery issue, my experience with the Dell G15 5520 has been excellent. The laptop's performance, screen quality, and overall build make it a fantastic choice for gamers and power users alike. The combination of Windows 11 and Microsoft Office 2021 adds to its appeal, providing a seamless and efficient user experience.In summary:Performance: Top-notch gaming performance with Intel i5-12500H, 16GB DDR5 RAM, and NVIDIA RTX 3050.Display: Superb screen quality with a 15.6\" FHD WVA AG 120Hz display.Design: Stylish backlit keyboard and robust build quality.Battery Life: Short battery life, only around 30 minutes of gaming on a single charge.Overall Experience: Despite the battery issue, an excellent gaming laptop.Overall, the Dell G15 5520 Gaming Laptop offers a great experience, provided you're prepared to deal with its limited battery life. If you're primarily using it in a stationary setup, this laptop will undoubtedly serve you well.",

It perfectly fits Lenovo Tab 4 10 plus. Just it would have been perfect with an automatic magnetic lock which is missing. The look/ print could also have been a bit trendy. It seems to be sturdy and durable , rest let's hope for the best. The additional good point to note is that it comes with little pocket in the front.;Easy to install, magnetic strength is good,good fit and weight, stability is also good;For anyone concerned.. This cover is worth every penny!I got it for 999 in some sale... It is value for money at that price.The cover is beautiful... It is sturdy.. Will keep your tablet in place... There are additional settings to prop it up...Overall a good buy if bought at 1000 bucks, considering that the cheap variety available in local market comes at 500 bucks... But looks 10 times as cheap!;This cover is of good quality and it has good features. It holds the tablet very well. However, it is not a proper fit for Lenovo M10 FHD REL. The back camera hole doesn't properly align with the camera of this model. Hence I would suggest to avoid for Lenovo M10 FHD REL.Also it is a bit expensive and the price should have been less than 1000.;Poor Quality, not worth of \u201cValue for Money.\u201dDefective piece received;The product was nice I also want to mention that this cover will not fit your device normally it has a unique way there must me a velcro just open it. That was the only that disturbed me because it took me a while to figure it out the design was as promised in the photo the durability of this cover is more than average it would be great if they would have given a flap but they inserted some magnets at the sides of this product so that's not a huge problem;GOOD!",

On opening after the return window was over it was found the product was broken and without cover on one side. This is nothing but cheating and un ethical business practice.;Very good screen guard. Perfect fit for my Lenovo M10 plus tablet. Buyer needs to be very particular about picking the right product as the tablet model names are really confusing.Nice packaging, sends all the cleaning material with it. If you are skillful and able to follow the instructions provided, you can install it on your own. No problem whatsoeverIt is claimed to have less finger print but it is a false claim. It attracts a lot of finger prints like the screen of the tablet.;The first thing before opening the packing i looked for an indicator which specified the model for which this screen protector was suitable. No indicator on the package. So the only way you can find out is by opening the package.After opening the accessories provided 1. Wet wipe 2. Dry wipe 3. Stickers are all of no use. Wet wipe is as dry as the dry wipe. The guide stickers have no glue whatsoever.The instruction are too brief. It makes it seem as if like installing the screen is a cake walk but it is not. After many tries i still ended up having air bubbles on the edges.How good the screen protector is only time will tell. But overall experience, when you expect all accessories required to install to be quality items, is less then satisfactory;This product fits 'Lenovo Tab M10 FHD Plus (3rd Gen) (10.61 inch (26.94 cm)' perfectly. I did good amount of research for this tab. This was the only Tempered Glass which mentioned the size and the device for which it will suit. As mentioned it did suit the tab properly.Easy to install.;Tempered glasses break easily. This did too when I bought this same product two months back. Let\u2019s see how long this one survives.

It's comes with proper cushion which protects my tablet form damages and falls. It's dust and water resistant and protect tablet from scratches and has a good design.

It\u2019s affordable, effective, and well-made. Highly recommended for Lenovo LOQ users who want to extend their keyboard's lifespan while keeping it looking new!Would definitely buy again! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcbb\u2728;Material is not bad, fit is good, not touching the screen, only wish for price of these products wont be above 300consPrice is too high for this product, only worth below 150.Some portion are not sitting right as it is slightly raised. Hope it will even out eventually.;The media could not be loaded.It is perfectly fit for Lenovo IdeaPad gaming 3 , 15.6 inches . I am impressed with the quality and the smoothness of the keyboard cover which I have not got in other cover . It is easy to apply , but it is bit more expensive than other cover . The cover thickness is a gradually good and I think it might protect your laptop keyboard  , slightly higher than the other cover . I think it might increase your performance to next level . As it is just my review from my perspective . You can also try it.Thank you Seller.;Yes. I'm not satisfied with the product but it is ok. I'm still gonna keep it.Reason:  There is no transparent space for the light of the Escape key , CAPS lock key, Num lock key. So during day we cannot know whether the key is enabled or not without trial and error.The product is very light weight when i blow air to remove any dust accumulated on the laptop, it fly away and i need to put it back.  The fit is ok But not very GREAT.The letters is not visible during night time even after turning the keyboard backlight ON. As the letters are printed and opaque. So the light unable to pass through it and visible. I use the help(assist) of the laptop display to see the letters and type.But these are not the reasons to not buy this because I don't know if there are any product without these issues as of now.  If yes, I'll buy that in future.This product is Good quality and easy to use and comfortable to experience.And the last thing is that this not 100% compatible with lenovo LOQ Because there is no copilot key in the product instead it has ctrl key. But that's ok. Just saying.;Good quality and perfect fit;Wanted to protect my new laptop keyboard from dust accumulation around the keys.Bought this without a second thought and it fits perfectly on my Lenovo Loq.They silicon gives a soft feeling while typing. I liked the original feeling of the keys, but can compromise on that.I got the transparent silicon version, since I wanted LED to show.Nice product.;Good. Perfect fit for ideapad gaming 3. Price is a bit high for the product.;It is durable you can fold it for long time as transparent also honestly it looks good and fit my Lenovo loq i5 12 gen rtx 3050 2024 perfectly it will protect from water drop but it will not protect from large quantity of liquid for example 1 glass of waterNote : you should remove cover if close laptop lid for long hours example 4 to 5 days or a weekBut no need to worry if you open laptop every day",

The AMD Ryzen processor is strong enough for regular use at home.As opposed to what many mention, the laptop does come with a backlit keyboard.There is a pre-installed Microsoft Office also ready to use. Just have to create an account if you don't have one and login.;Okay review after 3 months ? 2 months ? Idk I forgot anyways, the laptop is bigger than you'd expect, slim, light, above average performance!Pros :Back-lit keyboardAccessibility is numerous,Ryzen Processor > IntelDisplay : LargeColour contrast : Vibrant Colour, FHDCharging takes less time !Value for money ? Big yes !(Better than Ausus, HP, sorry not sorry but all my families use different laptop that's much pricier than this laptop but it outperforms ausus vivobook, hp)Cons :\u2022 Not for heavy gaming as it drains quiet fast when you play games on it ( on 100% it drained quiet fast when I played DOTA)\u2022 Bluetooth tend to stop working when you're using a wireless mouse/keyboard and Bluetooth earbuds both connected to the laptop (you have to disconnect either the ear buds or the mouse)Camera : TRASH (Sorry not sorry)Conclusion: Dont play heavy games, good for academic works ( if you're not a developer don't stress on it but learn python at the least lol )Should you buy it ?Yes, if it's well within your budget(It's better than vivobook :D);I bought this Lenovo Ideapad laptop 3 months ago and after use of less than 2 months battery is not taking charge. I called the Amazon customer care they told me to contact Lenovo customer care for support. And when I called Lenovo customer care they checked the laptop virtually by taker controls from Rescue Lens application and found that there is a issue with battery. And after 3-4 days one of their technician come to replace the battery and after replacing the battery issue still remains same. Then he troubleshooted and told us that its motherboard having issues so they have to replace motherboard. I asked them to replace full unit but they are denying. I again called the customer care of lenovo but they are denying to replace the unit. Also, when I bought this unit I found that the warranty on site shows expired. I think these lenovo company guys are so unprofessional and there is no management and quality check of the products.  At last I want to say please dont buy this product its unreliable.....Its waste of money.;Works excellentHas all featuresBattery works for good 5-6 hours on continuous working and watching video.Very smooth and sleek.Value for money.;;It doesn't have backlit keyboard but the device performance is efficient. Loads windows under 10 secs and no log observed so far. The sound quality is really good.;Every thing is good but you can not control blacklit keyboard intensity light. You can just turn it on or off. You can't change it to low, medium and high. And fingerprint senseor is not compatible for the hello window is showing.Good pointsPerformance is goodBattery is goodBad pointsYou can't ajust the light of keyboard. But you can it on/offFingerprint senor is not working error is showing.;Really good product from Lenovo. Awesome backlit. Very good display.",

Size and weight is not too much. All together it is value for money.;The media could not be loaded.Using it for a month and a halfPros:16gb ram is a wise choice for a coder.Screen Quality is good (Don't know why there were a lot of negative reviews about it), Genuine Windows 11 and MS office (great for students and content creators),Lightweight, easy and fast.Drawbacks:audio could have been better ( I use earphones and speaker so not an issue for me).definitely not a gaming laptop even if it advertises as such (xbox 3 month pass and I couldn't use it because video memory is lower than my previous lap)no backlit keyboard (it's not available in any IdeaPad slim 1)the metal body easily gets scratched and chipped (my advise is buy laptop bag or skin immediately, even a week is too late)Comment: first time ryzen user and gotta say it's good for everything outside gaming. Students and soft computer users can definitely go for this. If you're a gamer I would advise i5 and something with a graphic card. 16gb ram is better if you use a lot of softwares.;It's a good laptop for routine work not involving much graphics. Quality of body could have been better. Speaker audio is just about adequate. Worth the money paid;I received prodcut with defective speaker, sound quality is poor even at 100% volume. When I reached out to customer care they promised technician visit which did not happen, after called them again, I was promised return of the prodcut and refund to original payment. After multiple attempts, return was not picked up and refund was not provided. Amazon customer care told me, they started investigation why carrier did not pick-up and asked me wait for couple of days for resolution.  When I called after 3 days, I was told, everything is good on their side and they can not provide refund and won't be taking return as well.  This is daylight cheating and fradualent activity.  Customer care agent will provide template response and there is no esclation matrix for grievences.  I'm going to consumer court for on this matter.;Purchased this laptop to connect to office Citrix desktop and do work from home. Great speed and easy connectivity. I use my headset for audio and separate webcam for video calls so not tested the inbuilt webcam and speaker but should be pretty good. Worth the money and purchase.;Speed-5 starLooks-5 starCons- very less Usb ports and no LAN portOverall best choice.;The media could not be loaded.My personal review:1.Performance(Ram-16gb)Laptop runs smoothly even when you are multitasking and handles multiple tab opening easily.If you are not a heavy gamer ( you can play casual gaming easily  as well) but insteadwant a laptop for daily or office use, you will surely like this laptop.2. DisplayThe display is more than clear enough to watch movies or any content( obviously some would argue Oled display is better;but they come at a higher price as well).3.BatteryBattery lasts for around 3 hrs on a continuous usage( battery life could be better , but it's still ok at the price range)4.SoundSound quality is also good and clear .Sound loudness is more than enough , in my above video, the music video is being played at 56 volume which itself is loud enough for me.5.HeatingPersonally , not a heavy gamer , so heating has not been an issue for me.Final Review -If you never had a laptop and is thinking of getting this laptop, go for it , you won't get a better laptop at this price range.;In my point of this laptop is very very good because of its sound,screen,keyboard,and branding it has only one thing that is not good is it has not backlit if you think in photo it screen is not good but no my phone camera quality is not good if you think you will buy this laptop then you must and over all this laptop is so good and also have 65W charger",

                "text": "This is the best value gaming laptop under 70k Rs.The Good:1. Has a very good graphics card for gaming RTX 30502. Good build quality3. Good display and refresh rate 144 Hz4. Responsive, almost no lag5. Has MUX switch (can change the graphics card to dedicated or integrated)The Bad:1. The touchpad is very low quality2. 512 GB storageI did not include battery life as CON because gaming laptop generally have low battery life including this. MAX 3 hours;Update2: Lenovo has replaced motherboard and looks fine nowUpdate (the review at the end is after 2-3 weeks of usage).Laptop started crashing since a week, however it was getting restarted.3 days back (<2 months of usage), it crashed completely and not starting up. Filed a ticket to lenovo same day, some automated emails as of now, will update once I get it resolved.---------------------------------------------------------Bought it in Prime day sale @60k with card discounts. At this price it is very good machine.1. Performance (5/5)At this price, can't ask for anything more, both CPU/GPU are too good. Overall very fast responsive PC. I haven't tried ultra high graphics settings, but seems like 1080p gaming should run smooth. Ex. CS2 gives 200 FPS at default high settings in 1080p.2. Battery (2/5)I ran a 480p video with battery saver on, ran for ~1.5h from 100% battery. There is a \"Quite mode\" also, but it is unusable, makes PC very slow, videos also lag.And yes, battery drains (when connected) even with normal games. So I charge it atleast 50%, then can play for ~2 hours easily.3. Portability (2/5)This is a major issue with this. If you want to carry this regularly, checkout ideapad or some other laptop. This is very bulky, and charger is heavy too (plus cant take it without charger). Not for daily carriage.I wont even recommend putting it on lap for long. Basically, use it like a desktop.4. Boot Time (5/5)Start up, shut down both ~5 seconds5. Display (3/5)Not very crisp, brightness is also little less.6. Keyboard/Touchpad (4/5)7. Initial setup (5/5)Some people have mentioned that they needed to re-install windows and all, I just did the windows update, and everything is fine.8. Looks (3/5)I usually like simple look, but this is pretty boring for a gaming laptop.9. Built (5/5)Sturdy build. Very confident that nominal heat or impact wont cause issues.Other issues:1. Warranty was already used up for 1-2 months when I got it, maybe this is a returned product, but I didn't find any other issue, so kept it.2. Sometimes the power button doesn't turn red/while when we toggle between performance/balanced mode.;The battery life is gonna be bad, but it\u2019s expected for this beast of a machine at this price point. It handles demanding tasks like RDR2, GTA5, graphic editing, coding, and high-quality video playback with ease, staying cool without any issues so far. Some games might complain about low VRAM, but that\u2019s an easy fix. The screen quality is excellent as well.;The media could not be loaded.I was playing gow ragnarok (fitgirl repack)right now and the laptop turned off. No signs of power. 2 days back, had a camera issue, now the laptop itself is dead. Had purchased premium customer care support. They said the technician will come to look into it. Im cooked.Yesterday I downloaded the game and in the first hour the game crashed saying the gpu has either crashed or is not able to take the load, checked in nvidia experience and there was an update and it said \"fixed issues while playing gow crashes\" and there was one more fix which i don't remember.Research before you buy. I did that but as people said 13th/14th gen had these issues, but this is i5 12th gen. I guess no laptop is safe.;Everything of this laptop is top-notch.Loved the display, Sound, keyboard feedback, performance, sound etc.I had ordered the one with rtx 3090 (i5) and my main purpose of using was mostly editing on After effects,photoshop, gaming and a bit coding.This laptop handled everything very well as I was able to edit my videos in 4k smoothly and playing games on this LAPTOP will definitely impress you.Only thing is the battery which gives a backup around 3/3.5 hours and that too it has many modes like performance, quiet, battery saver etc so you can easily adjust in any mode according to your usage.Loved the creativity on the power button though won't spoil further if you are buying it you will definitely love that feature forsure.If you are looking for a good performance laptop under 60k or similar you should definitely go ahead with this laptop.It will easily manage all your tasks without any lag and it's definitely a \"VALUE FOR MONEY\" for sure.;Best display, Used premiere pro - Very smooth. There's no lag while playing games. It doesn't look like 100% gaming bulk laptop, It's 50-50 personal and gaming. Heating is there only while playing games and sometimes during editing videos. Performance is really good. Even the battery lasts for a decent duration. Speakers might be little issue in this, speakers are really low. 100% Value for money. just go for it. Got it for 55k in a sale with card offers.",

The AMD Ryzen processor is strong enough for regular use at home.As opposed to what many mention, the laptop does come with a backlit keyboard.There is a pre-installed Microsoft Office also ready to use. Just have to create an account if you don't have one and login.;Okay review after 3 months ? 2 months ? Idk I forgot anyways, the laptop is bigger than you'd expect, slim, light, above average performance!Pros :Back-lit keyboardAccessibility is numerous,Ryzen Processor > IntelDisplay : LargeColour contrast : Vibrant Colour, FHDCharging takes less time !Value for money ? Big yes !(Better than Ausus, HP, sorry not sorry but all my families use different laptop that's much pricier than this laptop but it outperforms ausus vivobook, hp)Cons :\u2022 Not for heavy gaming as it drains quiet fast when you play games on it ( on 100% it drained quiet fast when I played DOTA)\u2022 Bluetooth tend to stop working when you're using a wireless mouse/keyboard and Bluetooth earbuds both connected to the laptop (you have to disconnect either the ear buds or the mouse)Camera : TRASH (Sorry not sorry)Conclusion: Dont play heavy games, good for academic works ( if you're not a developer don't stress on it but learn python at the least lol )Should you buy it ?Yes, if it's well within your budget(It's better than vivobook :D);I bought this Lenovo Ideapad laptop 3 months ago and after use of less than 2 months battery is not taking charge. I called the Amazon customer care they told me to contact Lenovo customer care for support. And when I called Lenovo customer care they checked the laptop virtually by taker controls from Rescue Lens application and found that there is a issue with battery. And after 3-4 days one of their technician come to replace the battery and after replacing the battery issue still remains same. Then he troubleshooted and told us that its motherboard having issues so they have to replace motherboard. I asked them to replace full unit but they are denying. I again called the customer care of lenovo but they are denying to replace the unit. Also, when I bought this unit I found that the warranty on site shows expired. I think these lenovo company guys are so unprofessional and there is no management and quality check of the products.  At last I want to say please dont buy this product its unreliable.....Its waste of money.;Works excellentHas all featuresBattery works for good 5-6 hours on continuous working and watching video.Very smooth and sleek.Value for money.;;It doesn't have backlit keyboard but the device performance is efficient. Loads windows under 10 secs and no log observed so far. The sound quality is really good.;Every thing is good but you can not control blacklit keyboard intensity light. You can just turn it on or off. You can't change it to low, medium and high. And fingerprint senseor is not compatible for the hello window is showing.Good pointsPerformance is goodBattery is goodBad pointsYou can't ajust the light of keyboard. But you can it on/offFingerprint senor is not working error is showing.;Really good product from Lenovo. Awesome backlit. Very good display.",

Awesome screen and looks premium. The keyboard is good. Got it for 48k in sale. The power back up is very poor which is only disadvantage I observed. The sound is very low. Many people complained MOBO. Will update after few weeksAfter a week of use, I loved everything about this laptop. Found no problem. Using this mostly for office work and entertainment. In batter save mode got 3.5hrs. in normal mode, hardly getting 1.5 to 2 hrs. In rapid charging mode, charged fully within 1 hr, which is quite good for me. Main drawbacks are sound, which is very low even in full volume, not good for people who watches movies and stuff in laptop. The camera quality is below par, totally disappointed with camera.;Battery drain is the only issue. Rest it is a fantastic laptop with premium build.;Here I bought 512GB SSD and when laptop is delivered it has 474GB SSD;I was quietly impressed with this LOQ series..Holding the box for first time doesn't feels like a gaming laptop \ud83d\udcbb . Having such a powerful processor and graphics card the weight of laptop is really nice . I played Gta 5 for around 1 2 hours in this case the laptop doesn't heat to much and also fan noise are not to loud. Lenevo really making this series looks like legion . Appreciate it lenevo.;Does everything you expect of it. Very sturdy and smooth.Battery life is slightly disappointing though, lasts 3-4 hours of using things like Word and PowerPoint as well, which is not ideal, but considering the hardware, somewhat expected. To be fair Lenovo has mentioned that on a packaging film beforehand itself.Does not have pre-installed activated MS Office, has to be bought separately (the Lenovo website version says that it has it).Otherwise pretty good.;The laptop is as good as I thought. No issues, no problem. I am an occasional gamer, so for me, it's good. And video editing is smooth.I don't know why people complaint about sound, the sound is satisfactory.The display is top notch and battery life is also good (approx 4 hrs on 100% charge). Makes no noise. Built quality is royal.Loved it.;It is a mid range laptop ,sound quality is superb, but its comes with low volume .Display:It comes with 300nits .Its excellent experience gives to user.Keyboard keys: very good key travel is superb,respond time also good.Track pad: very smooth response is good.Web cam :it is comes with 720p quality.Overall rating : I give 4out of 5 .",

                "text": "I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?\u00a0Absolutely!;I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.;The media could not be loaded.Hi guys, Here is my review after using this laptop.Laptop pro's - Design, price and performance.Laptop design - This laptop's design feels premium and nice.Laptop performance - It can handle GTA 5 smoothly. Also can record gameplay.Laptop thermals - Laptop gets hot only during gaming. But it doesn't over heat as far as I used.Laptop con's - I noticed some bugs/glitches like cursor while using in typing area or text box it gets white or kinda invisible I feel this maybe a bug.-Screen goes off for a second sometimes while playing videos or browsing especially in battery power.-Blue screen error: I have faced blue screen error two times till now while switching from power mode to battery mode(plugging out adapter).;The media could not be loaded.I bought an Asus TUF GAMING 15 from amazon on 16/10/2024. After 5 days it had many problems (it suddenly shut down, I thought the battery must have run out, so I charged the laptop and turned it on (it turned on after 5 minutes and the battery was still 40%) and after 1 hour windows crashed and after 1 day windows crashed 3 times, and keyboard light is not working properly ,then I sent it for replacement and AMAZON people said that the tech technician would visit on 27/10/2024 but the technician did not come on the 27th, I contacted Amazon on 1st Nov, they said that your product will be refunded, the DELHIVERY agent will pick up your product on 2nd Nov,\u00a0but they are not picked my product PLEASE REFUND ME MY MONEY;This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a \"battery care mode\" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!!This review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!!Top notch5/5 stars!!!;The media could not be loaded.Best quality,even after 5 hour gaming no Heat ,  display quality is excellent , very smooth, value for money,the only issue is battery \ud83d\udd0b backup is low;Got it for 54,999rs.4 years old hardware and body, renewed with latest SSD, RAM and processorPros:Processor is blazing fastRAM and SSD speed is good ( add 16gb additionally)Keyboard is niceLaptop design is niceUpgradable slots given for both storage and RAMCons:1-1.5hr battery life ( Draining)Heavy weight including charger2021 Old hardware ( mouse pad not good )Laptop build quality not goodAverage GPU (rtx 2050)Not IPS displayWorst speakersHope this helps !",

The battery life is impressive, lasting through a full day of work without needing a recharge. The display is vibrant and crisp, making it perfect for both work and entertainment.Overall, this laptop offers fantastic value for its price, and I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable and powerful device.;Good utility PC considering the price at which this is coming.Ryzen 7000 processor seemed to be just coping up with the system load. Have another Ryzen 5000 1-2 year old laptops that performs better, feel more sturdy, good looking and is faster which also come at the same price point.Good for students but not sure about business needs.Battery life is good;I'll love the performance... Soo  good \ud83d\ude0a;For the price, the build quality is decent. Performance of the Ryzen5 processor is decent, definitely not at the level of the i5's. The screen quality is the weakest link here, too much screen whitewash, not able to get the color calibration right. My 2018 Asus laptop has better screen quality.Overall it is a decent buy for regular office use.;Worse product I have ever seen1)it is not powering on for 20 minutes after get on it is getting stuck and buffering only for 10 to 15 min2) mouse pad is not working3) build quality is very poor4) after I am complaining about it they only tell me that 'Sorry sir we can't refund you'NOTE: THINK 100 TIMES BEFORE YOU BUY THIS LAPTOP;It is an amazing laptop for this price range it offers a great performance, does miss the backlit keyboard also there is some cost cutting for the screen colour combination for the lower variants. But the quality it gives is just premium it's a great laptop for college going students/ for programming.;;Must add the backlit keyboard to this product.",

Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?\u00a0Absolutely!;I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.;The media could not be loaded.Hi guys, Here is my review after using this laptop.Laptop pro's - Design, price and performance.Laptop design - This laptop's design feels premium and nice.Laptop performance - It can handle GTA 5 smoothly. Also can record gameplay.Laptop thermals - Laptop gets hot only during gaming. But it doesn't over heat as far as I used.Laptop con's - I noticed some bugs/glitches like cursor while using in typing area or text box it gets white or kinda invisible I feel this maybe a bug.-Screen goes off for a second sometimes while playing videos or browsing especially in battery power.-Blue screen error: I have faced blue screen error two times till now while switching from power mode to battery mode(plugging out adapter).;The media could not be loaded.I bought an Asus TUF GAMING 15 from amazon on 16/10/2024. After 5 days it had many problems (it suddenly shut down, I thought the battery must have run out, so I charged the laptop and turned it on (it turned on after 5 minutes and the battery was still 40%) and after 1 hour windows crashed and after 1 day windows crashed 3 times, and keyboard light is not working properly ,then I sent it for replacement and AMAZON people said that the tech technician would visit on 27/10/2024 but the technician did not come on the 27th, I contacted Amazon on 1st Nov, they said that your product will be refunded, the DELHIVERY agent will pick up your product on 2nd Nov,\u00a0but they are not picked my product PLEASE REFUND ME MY MONEY;This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a \"battery care mode\" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!!This review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!!Top notch5/5 stars!!!;The media could not be loaded.Best quality,even after 5 hour gaming no Heat ,  display quality is excellent , very smooth, value for money,the only issue is battery \ud83d\udd0b backup is low;Got it for 54,999rs.4 years old hardware and body, renewed with latest SSD, RAM and processorPros:Processor is blazing fastRAM and SSD speed is good ( add 16gb additionally)Keyboard is niceLaptop design is niceUpgradable slots given for both storage and RAMCons:1-1.5hr battery life ( Draining)Heavy weight including charger2021 Old hardware ( mouse pad not good )Laptop build quality not goodAverage GPU (rtx 2050)Not IPS displayWorst speakersHope this helps !",

                "text": "Very good product, I afraid to see most of the reviews, but it's must buying product. Amazon packing is amazing. Thank you Amazon for this type of service. Fingerprint sensor is amazing and Full HD screen is also good. Battery life is also good around to 5 hours, compared to other windows laptop;I bought this laptop at effective price of 30000  with all the cashback etc. Which is reasonably well, considering nowadays phones of 8 gb Ram are also in the same price range.Ofcourse there are some shortcomings but I understand why they are there. Manufacturer have to drop something to provide this laptop at great price. Really good for students who can't afford expensive laptops. Even 60-70 thousand laptops are not useful after a while. I'm intending to use this for 2 years, so I guess this will do the jobPros:1. Battery life is good, you can easily use it for 6 hours with average use. I suggest to use dark theme to further increase the battery life.2. Performance is good, so far able to handle multi tasking. I tried copying data, the tranfer was super fast.3. Build quality is good, considering a non- metallic back, it looks good, light and portable.4. Camera Sutter is nice feature at this price point.5. Finger print scanner.6. Microsoft office licence.Cons:1. Speakers are useless, low volume. Taking meetings on this laptop would be difficult as well. Workaround is that to carry earphones all the time.2. No USB charging, it would have been great. Now I have to carry two charges, one for phone and another for laptop.3. Keyboard have lesser spacing inbetween the keys, I kept pressing wrong keys all the time. More surprising is the fact that there's 1 inch space left either side of the keyboard. Not sure why they squeeze keys in limited space.4. Camera quality is also poor, looks like a camera from 2006 laptop.5. Display is also really average, when you look at different angles it doesn't work that we'll.6. Heating is also felt, I haven't started using the laptop, just exploring it still I could hear the fan running.;Build Quality: 4/5The laptop has excellent build quality. Although it doesn't feature a metal body, the polycarbonate material used is of good quality and feels sturdy.Keyboard: 2/5The keyboard feels uncomfortable to use. The build quality seems cheap, and it lacks aesthetic appeal. It does not provide a satisfactory typing experience, especially for someone who works extensively on a laptop.Power Management: 2.5/5Power management is just average. It neither excels in battery backup nor provides efficient usage for long durations. A mediocre performance overall in this department.Display: 1/5As someone with 10 years of IT experience and extensive exposure to different laptops, this display is by far the worst I have encountered. The quality is extremely poor, making it unsuitable even for basic tasks. This is a major drawback and a significant reason I would no longer consider ASUS laptops in this price range (\u20b926,000).Performance: 3/5The laptop is powered by an i3-1235U/1215U processor and 8GB of RAM. For the price, it's adequate for basic tasks such as video playback and office documentation. However, it is not built for multitasking or more demanding applications, which is understandable given the specifications.Price: 3/5Considering the display quality, even a price below \u20b920,000 would not justify this purchase. There are better options available in this range, and the display alone makes it hard to recommend this laptop.Overall: 2/5This laptop has been a lifetime worst experience for me. The display is horrible\u2014very bad quality, and the performance is just passable for basic tasks. Power management is average at best. Overall, this laptop fails to deliver value for its price and does not meet expectations, even as a budget device. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone;Good laptop at this price point. Thin and light. Sturdy body.;I recently purchased the Asus Vivobook 14 and unfortunately, my experience has been quite frustrating. While the laptop initially seemed promising, I've encountered significant issues with the touchpad that has significantly impacted my overall satisfaction.Touchpad Issues:* Inconsistent Tracking: The touchpad often exhibits inconsistent tracking, making it difficult to navigate smoothly and accurately. This can be particularly annoying when performing precise tasks or gaming.* Accidental Clicks: The touchpad is overly sensitive, leading to accidental clicks and cursor jumps. This can be frustrating and disruptive, especially when typing or working on documents.Other Concerns:While I haven't experienced any major performance issues, the build quality feels a bit flimsy for a laptop at this price point. The plastic casing doesn't inspire confidence in its durability.Except this issue I have faced, there is another drawback of purchasing this laptop is keyboard is without backlit support but on App they mentioned that this laptop has backlit chiclet keyboard.Conclusion:I'm disappointed with my purchase of the Asus Vivobook 14. The touchpad issue and non availability of backlit keyboard, have significantly hindered my enjoyment of the laptop. If you're considering this model, I would strongly recommend researching other options or carefully considering these potential drawbacks.",

Highly intelligent fingerprint: (if you are turning on your PC with your registered fingerprint then it will directly log you in.)5. Thunderbolt 4.6. Light weight 1.7kgs.7. 180deg hinge (it comes handy when you accidently push your screen back, most screen or hinges gets damages due to 120deg hinge)8. I got this laptop for 84k, but while I'm writing this its 87k.9. Aluminum back of the display.Pros of HP Victus 16:1. Processor: Ryzen 7 79840HS is more powerful than intel i5 13500H2.

The MSI Katana A17 AI not only meets but often exceeds my high expectations in performance. Powered by a Ryzen 7 8845HS and equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, this laptop handles intensive tasks seamlessly without any lag or stutter, a must for graphic design and game development.Battery Life: The battery performance is robust, delivering between 3-4 hours of heavy use and extending up to 5-6 hours for lighter tasks. This is quite impressive for a high-performance gaming laptop, where intensive use usually takes a toll on battery life.Display Quality: The visuals are sharp and smooth on the 44cm FHD display, enhanced by a 144Hz refresh rate which is a boon for gaming and dynamic media consumption. However, the display bezels are on the thicker side, which slightly detracts from an otherwise immersive experience.Speaker Quality: The speakers deliver good audio clarity, enhancing the gaming and multimedia experience. However, they could benefit from a bit more volume to truly match the laptop's overall power and performance.Build and Design: Weighing in at 2.7kg, the laptop is relatively portable for a gaming model. The overall build is sturdy and aesthetically pleasing with a sleek black finish.Room for Improvement: My major gripe is with the size of the display bezels \u2014 a slimmer option would enhance the visual experience. Additionally, the lack of a Type-C charger is a missed opportunity for convenience, especially given the widespread adoption of USB-C for charging and data transfer across devices.Final Thoughts: The MSI Katana A17 AI is a powerful ally for both gamers and professional creators. While it excels in performance, display quality, and audio clarity, a few design tweaks and an update in charging options could make it an unbeatable choice in its category.;Thanks its good product you should buy recommend;This product is a value for money. The physical design is average but the built is very robust. I still have to test out the battery life on the long-run.It's definitely a powerful machine and very suitable for gaming and I have bought this for gaming and CAD tools.. so far it is handling everything I threw at it very smoothly. Would recommend this product.;The media could not be loaded.The only thing you won't regret ever for buying if you love coding, gaming, content creating, etc. Its just simple three words- GO FOR IT!!!  MSI truly understands reasonable pricing for people who want high performance in good value and this is one example. I really suggest you all, go for it.;After a lot of thought, finally got a gaming laptop.And this laptop almost fits what I wanted.This model lacks reviews from reputable sources anywhere online.This was a big and expensive gamble for me.And delivery took 20 days from order date, exactly.So 20 days of warranty loss I guess.Was very disappointed when I saw the delivery dates.Price wise seems to be reasonable I guess, considering a 105W RTX 4060.Never thought 16GB RAM won't be sufficient for modern games.RAM is upgradeable though upto 64GB according to MSI.Wanted to try out and AMD processor after the Athlon 64 days.And I find it zippy considering I am upgrading after 10 years.While playing videos of 720p to 4K, their are many artifacts, hiccups and glitches in hybrid graphics mode.But none of that in discrete graphics mode.Games run smooth and great but the temperatures scares me.CPU and GPU hits 100C while gaming, after which it start slowing everything down and framerates starts dropping.So bought a cooling pad and now max CPU temperatures are 90 and GPU is 90, but the GPU RAM is always 94 and above.The ventilation holes in the bottom panel are very different.None above the fan are provide.Maybe trying to direct airflow through other components before it exits through the cooler.But in winter we can use the exhausts to warm our hands, cuz it gets very hot.2 slots of nvme are their out of which we get 1TB on one slot and the other one vacant, but no mounting hardware is provided.From box to the laptop to the MSI software, everywhere its written for any upgrades consult MSI services center.Sadly their is no MSI service centre in my city.So does that mean I cant perform an upgrade?!For now loving this new laptop after 10 years.Lets see in the long run how it holds up at 90-100 degrees centigrade of thermals.Even on a hill station, at 15\u00b0C of ambient temperature, its running at 90\u00b0-100\u00b0C;This laptop ticks all the boxes to be called as beast. I am using it for last 20 days for my high end software application development. Excellent build qualities. The key boards are very punchy but soft to use. The display is good. Over all its abest purpose I bought it in recent times.",

                "text": "I've been using the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 with AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS for a few weeks now, and I'm impressed by its raw power and features. Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?\u00a0Absolutely!;I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.;The media could not be loaded.Hi guys, Here is my review after using this laptop.Laptop pro's - Design, price and performance.Laptop design - This laptop's design feels premium and nice.Laptop performance - It can handle GTA 5 smoothly. Also can record gameplay.Laptop thermals - Laptop gets hot only during gaming. But it doesn't over heat as far as I used.Laptop con's - I noticed some bugs/glitches like cursor while using in typing area or text box it gets white or kinda invisible I feel this maybe a bug.-Screen goes off for a second sometimes while playing videos or browsing especially in battery power.-Blue screen error: I have faced blue screen error two times till now while switching from power mode to battery mode(plugging out adapter).;The media could not be loaded.I bought an Asus TUF GAMING 15 from amazon on 16/10/2024. After 5 days it had many problems (it suddenly shut down, I thought the battery must have run out, so I charged the laptop and turned it on (it turned on after 5 minutes and the battery was still 40%) and after 1 hour windows crashed and after 1 day windows crashed 3 times, and keyboard light is not working properly ,then I sent it for replacement and AMAZON people said that the tech technician would visit on 27/10/2024 but the technician did not come on the 27th, I contacted Amazon on 1st Nov, they said that your product will be refunded, the DELHIVERY agent will pick up your product on 2nd Nov,\u00a0but they are not picked my product PLEASE REFUND ME MY MONEY;This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a \"battery care mode\" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!!This review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!!Top notch5/5 stars!!!;The media could not be loaded.Best quality,even after 5 hour gaming no Heat ,  display quality is excellent , very smooth, value for money,the only issue is battery \ud83d\udd0b backup is low;Got it for 54,999rs.4 years old hardware and body, renewed with latest SSD, RAM and processorPros:Processor is blazing fastRAM and SSD speed is good ( add 16gb additionally)Keyboard is niceLaptop design is niceUpgradable slots given for both storage and RAMCons:1-1.5hr battery life ( Draining)Heavy weight including charger2021 Old hardware ( mouse pad not good )Laptop build quality not goodAverage GPU (rtx 2050)Not IPS displayWorst speakersHope this helps !",

                "text": "I received it today from Amazon. This has so far really impressed me! The workflow is smooth. The screen is definitely 1080 and you can tell that as soon as you reach to Windows screen for the first time. I have used an HP laptop before with i3 5th gen processor and this laptop has not disappointed me so far. I will write about my experience after a month. Disclaimer - you can still upgrade this laptop up to 24gb as it still has an extra RAM slot.Edit#6: The charger adapter has become so annoying! The charger plug that goes into the side of the laptop so thin that even the slightest of shake make it break the current. This is especially annoying given that you get system popup notification whenever charger is connected or disconneted. Thinking replacing the charger may help.Edit #5: Received a call today from ASUS and they said this device does not support XMP profile settings. But they said it should be running at 3200 mhz so they are further digging into the problem why it is 2667 instead. Thanks to ASUS for clearing my doubt.Edit #4: I talked to customer care through email. They were not able to figure out why the new 3200 mhz RAM is running at 2667. Neither did they give reason for absence of XMP profile settings in the BIOS. Really disappointed! And they took 5-6 days just to comes up with this \"We do apologize for any inconvenience we would like to inform you that as per the serial number provided the unit has onboard RAM of 4GB and the unit below specification of RAM can be added to the unit: DDR4 3200 SO-D 8GB 260P.\" And I do not really understand what does this even mean! I have 8gb RAM not 4 and I know it supports 3200 then again my question is why my 3200 RAM is running at 2667? Really smh ffs. Earlier I talked to chat and he referred me to nearest service centre. Of course I didn't go and instead preferred to talk on mail with someone else. Uploaded the picture. Check the speed.Edit #3: Installed an extra 8GB 3200 Mhz RAM to make it 16gb and dual channel. Here is a limitation too. In dual channel, the Iris Xe graphics is activated, but dual channel is running in 2667 mhz speed. I tried XMP setting but there is no XMP settings in this laptop's BIOS! But anyways, 2x8 @ 2667 will outperform 1x8GB @ 3200 at any point of time. So, I am happy overall.Edit #2: BONKERS! Now I realize why this 12th gen laptop is at a very low price! The 8gb RAM is x16 (4 chips on RAM) instead of x8 (8 chips on RAM).  That too of Samsung company (made in china). Well that does not make a lot of difference, but still x8 would have been nice. The difference is 20% on performance. If your are a heavy multitasker, go for it blindly, but for Gamers, not today. Also the RAM is soldered into the motherboard (yes I opened my new laptop!) so it somewhat makes up for that low performance which may reduce it to 5-10% less performance compared to x8 RAM. Also, SSD is of Intel 670p series (made in china). Also battery is 3640mah (made in china). So, the brand is Tiwanese, but product is Chinese.Edit #1: instead of one month, I am here after 10 days since I have used it enough to qualify to write its complete review. I won't write anymore, unless I face any major issue in the laptop.1. First off, laptop is top notch! I brought it for heavy multitasking (reallyyy heavy) and it never lagged. Starts within 5-8 seconds owing to its powerful processor and nvme drive.2. It is very light. I used a laptop of hp before which was around 2 kgs. So, this one is very light imo.3. I have not experienced any glitch or sort and hopefully never will.4. I have not tested battery so much since I keep my laptop in charging mode always. I just tested it once while multitasking and it gave me 8 hours of backup, maybe because I have dark mode turned on everywhere.5. I do not know much about cooling system as I am not a gamer. All I can say is unless you go for very heavy task, application or gaming, you won't even feel that this laptop has a fan and it's running. You really won't feel it even when you take your ears nearest to fan area. It is that silent! Also, it has ventilation from three sides - left side, back and in the down panel. So, even if you put it on sofa or bed, rest of the two vetilation will make sure the laptop is not getting heated.6. On color choice, I would highly recommend you choose 'Iceblue silver'. I brought it and it is just stunning. It makes the laptop more than a premium device.7. The fingerprint sensor is fast as hell. It will recognize your fingerprint even if you just take off your finger within half a second.8. Yes, an important issue you will definitely face is graphics. What company claims is this laptop has Iris Xe graphics, but in fact it shows UHD graphics when you check in laptop when you get it. Let me explain, it does have Iris Xe hardware. But, laptop shows UHD becuase of single RAM (single channel). To activate Iris Xe, you will have to insert another ram with same speed to enable your laptop to operate on dual channel mode (google it). But, a hardware is a hardware, no matter the name. Thus, your laptop will work same as Iris Xe even when it says UHD as it won't make difference in graphics hardware. Vivo is not at fault here, but Intel as they want Iris Xe good ratings which is possible in dual channel mode only.9. Did something bothered me? Yes. The power button is just another button on num pad! Initially you surely will accidently press it if you are used to button which was in its place in your last laptop. At least ASUS should have made it red or something to distinguish it from the rest of the keys. Anyways, it is not an issue for me at all.10. I don't care much about sound as I am not the guy who watches YouTube and listens to music. It has a pretty decent sound though. It is loud and clear. Again, do not expect a DJ system inside a laptop.11. It does not have a backlit keypad system. I don't care about it anyways as I have enough experience to type correctly even in dark.To conclude, I would say go for this laptop. I was skeptic earlier to buy ASUS as I had never used it before, but this laptop changed everything. I had thought of buying Xiaomi Ultra book which has 11300H processor (H series) instead of P series, as the case with this laptop. But when you compare 11300H and 1240p, the latter far outperforms the former. The 1240p also has far more cores and threads that 11300H. Anyways, Xiaomi is chinese, while ASUS is Tiwanese. I don't need to explain whose quality is better and which one to choose to support democracy, freedom of speech and our soldiers in India. Just go for this beautiful, super laptop. You won't regret.Also, you would be confused with ASUS and HP in the same price segment and same specifications. Let me tell you one thing. Both in the same segment has same specifications, but HP will give you dual channel 8gb laptop (4x2) while ASUS will give you single channel 8gb RAM (8x1), leaving another slot to make it 16 gb dual channel. So, you can easily insert another 8gb ram in ASUS, while in HP, you will have to buy two 8gb rams to make it 16gb or one 8gb ram would make HP only 12gb. So, this laptop stands out in every dimension from its competitors.;Its really good and easy to handle ir;Good for students and teachers. This is my 2nd laptop and working fine.;Speakers are not lot loud enough. Even little external disturbances makes the audio unaudible.Moreover, not suitable even for an average level of gaming. You would have to settle for low average graphic games of 2010 era;I got this laptop for 35000 offer which is best deal, try to get 16 GB because 8 gb gb looks ok after upgrading to 16 GB now my laptop works faster.;Doesn't work as expected.  Works very slow . Even Excel hangs and does not work.;I bought this laptop and it's reallyamazing to use even I like it's quality very much, I am only disappointed with its speaker they are in under downside in the laptop and their volume is very low only sound is disappointed me, you can definitely buy this product but only issue is of sound..;Good sound quality and battery performance",

                "text": "I have bought this laptop recently in sale. The laptop is equipped with a powerful processor so doing editing and daily usage is seamless. The laptop is light weight at 1.8 kg and has a good colour accurate display with ample brightness. I tested two games so far, Forza Horizon 5 and F1 23. I played on ultra settings and got avg 75 fps and temp were at 70-75 degree Celsius max. It comes with Xbox game pass free for 3 months, so I got the games for free. It also comes with lifetime MS office. The built quality is good. The only thik I think needs improvement is the touch pad which seems a bit wobbly if you pay attention.Overall at 71.5k, this is a real good laptop for some one who is looking to play games casually, do advance editing and office/personal work.;Update 21 jan 2025. Broken back cover due to hinge.No action taken by Amazon. So I start using at my home lightly , and 1.5 month did not used as I was out side city.Internal Back cover screw place damaged due to hinge tighteness , kind of manufacturing defect , visited service centre told me 3000-4000 cost , now see under warranty product condition , it\u2019s quite weak laptop, avoid to buy , thnxReview after purchase(old)I purchased an ASUS laptop on October 18, 2024, through Amazon. Just 2-3 days after receiving it, I noticed an excessive heating issue, which prompted me to reach out to Amazon customer care for a return. However, instead of processing the return directly, they suggested that I visit an ASUS service center. Following their advice, I visited the service center, where I received a DOA (Dead on Arrival) approval. ASUS packaged the laptop using their special packing material and instructed me not to tamper with it.On November 1, Amazon scheduled a pickup, but it was rejected because the ASUS-approved packaging  could not be opened for inspection. This led to a series of rescheduled pickups, all of which failed due to the same issue.It\u2019s been a never-ending cycle of rescheduling, calling Amazon multiple times (over 10 calls by now), and dealing with service complications. As a programmer who depends heavily on a functional laptop for work, being left without one has caused immense disruption and wasted valuable time. Both Amazon and ASUS have shown poor coordination and service, making the return process unnecessarily frustrating. If you\u2019re considering buying electronics online, think twice \u2014 this experience has made me question the convenience of online purchases compared to buying from a physical store. I cant say anything about the seller. but issue in amazon pickup policy how they do.;First day the battery backup was  3 to 4 hours for normal workSecond day battery backup was good like it as  above 4 hours backupCons are :-1.Hitsup during heavy tasks In that time battery backup is below 3 hours2. Speekers are not good low volumePros are :-1.Good in multitasking2.Display is also goodIf your are a student go for it;it is best laptop under 70000k battery life 3hr ,wt. 1.8kg, 3050rtx ,13gen ,screen quality is also good;But I see some kind of battery going fast drain sometimes, and sometimes seem to be fine. I don't understand.;Display quality, performance all is good but battery life is horrible.Belive me with mild work like watching YouTube it's battery only lasts for 2.5hour max (on 60% brightness);After using this laptop for just two months, I can confidently say it\u2019s the worst one I\u2019ve ever owned. The issues started piling up almost immediately:Hinge Problems: Within two months, the hinge came loose, making the laptop feel fragile and unreliable.Screen Issues: The screen suddenly went black and became completely unusable, leaving me frustrated and unable to work.Terrible Battery Life: The battery barely lasts 1 to 1.5 hours, which is far below what was advertised.Frequent Freezing: The laptop freezes randomly, interrupting my work and making even simple tasks a hassle.Overall Poor Build Quality: Beyond these issues, the laptop has several other problems, showing a complete lack of quality control.I expected much better durability and performance for the price. Unfortunately, this laptop has been nothing but a disappointment. Save yourself the trouble and look for a more reliable option!;it is good product. it does have a bit of noise in fan . Rest is good. Not very good for heavy gaming. Because it has 55 tgp gpu. It has very good performance for task i have done till now. Heat level did not increased much because i did not do any heavy work or used it for longer session. Right now it has proper build not defect its track pad does not work",

I know this phone looks promising and with that huge discount but please this particular model is trash.I purchased this phone on December 2024 and now today the phone completely died while I was gaming. And the company is denying warranty.;This Phone is definitely worth buying specially for gamers as this phone is a literal gaming beast under budget too, why saying gaming beast because it can handle any games easily cuz of its ram, possessor with snapdragon and the GPU also in the X mode this phone litterely transforms into a beast but this phone beats a lot especially in games like genshin impact of a long session of bgmi or cod with max graphics or other high end games but games like free fire and minecraft and more medium and low end games cuz the phone heating but a less heating but buying a fan for this phone will be a great option for heating problem, also people says that it's good for gaming but bad for normal use but it's false statement as I am using this phone for 4+ months and this phone still works perfectly, the camera, battery life, sound quality, charging are just best than many other phones specially the sound quality and fast charging is literal beast. Also the display is of gorilla glass which is hard, I have dropped my phone for more than 5 times but still no crack. In overall this phone after 4+ months still works like a new one, so if you like it from my comment than this is worth buying;The media could not be loaded.A beast in 35k Range.!! Why GO for other gaming or high performance when you have ASUS ROG?I purchased this phone on 15 Nov,24. First time it did not start at all until I charged it fully which was rather fast.Edit: After 2 months the phone is Dead, warranty says device warranty lapsed on 2022 and i bought it on 2024. Warranty claim issue, the device needs to be taken to Kolkata which is 700km far from my city.Then everything was COOL.*The phone was 12/256 model with USC type-c 3.1 Fast Charge and data support.Air trigger are butter smooth. Mic Quality is also superb.I upgraded my phone from ROG 2 to 5s and the Sound Quality Difference was EPIC. EXTREMELY LOUD.Everything in this Phone is Awsome. Yeah i was little hesitant to buy this from AMAZON but it came good.**Only small issue is when I go select Loudspeakers while in normal call the mic is not able to catch my voice properly in distance that's all in Cons.People who calls this phone bad or something may have issues with their units but as a whole ASUS provides the best product ever, from their Asus ROG Laptops to Phones and everything.;why noise cancellation happens with all video calls, I'm unable to hear my baby voice;Like most;Don't purchase this phone. Over heating and now wifi and hotspot is not working;And want to buy the phone Awesome phone and wonderful display nice phone and coming on the the nice phone;The media could not be loaded.Don't buy this phone suddenly mobile is of while using the phone money waste I want my money back",

                "text": "The media could not be loaded.As a first-time laptop user, the Dell 15 has exceeded my expectations with its excellent performance and versatile features. I primarily use this laptop for trading, watching movies, and general productivity tasks, and it has proven to be more than capable for all my needs.**Performance and Display:**Equipped with an Intel 12th Gen Core i3 processor and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop delivers smooth and responsive performance, even when multitasking between multiple applications. The 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a stunning visual experience, making movies come to life and enhancing the fluidity of my trading charts.**Portability and Build Quality:**Weighing just 1.69kg and featuring a thin and lightweight design, the Dell 15 is easy to carry around, whether I'm working from home or on the go. The spill-resistant keyboard adds a layer of durability, giving me peace of mind against accidental spills during long trading sessions or movie marathons.**Value for Money:**At a price of 29k, this laptop offers exceptional value for money. With its solid performance, vibrant display, and practical features, it competes favorably with higher-priced alternatives on the market. For a first-time laptop buyer like myself, it's reassuring to know that I've made a wise investment in a reliable and versatile computing device.**Future Updates:**I plan to update this review after six months of using the Dell 15, providing valuable insights into its long-term performance, durability, and any additional features or drawbacks I may discover over time. This will be helpful for others who are considering purchasing the same laptop and are looking for real-world experiences.**Final Thoughts:**Overall, the Dell 15 has been an outstanding first laptop for me. Its combination of performance, display quality, portability, and affordability makes it an ideal choice for users looking for a versatile companion for everyday computing tasks. Whether you're a student, professional, or casual user, the Dell 15 delivers a compelling user experience that punches above its price point. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for their first laptop or a reliable upgrade.Edit: today 7 September 2024 my hinges broked but because of dell service they replaced my hinges and laptop upper body \ud83d\udc45 , Hinges were hard and after replacement they're very smooth like Amul butter. Zero rupees replacement! Just call customer care and told everything! Within 2 days engineer visit and fixed it!, check my images and videos.Overall laptop is great \ud83d\ude38! I bought this laptop only 29k because of credit card discount..;I ordered this laptop and I had received old and used laptop in open box. Orignal box was open which was kept inside good amazon outer box, so I couldn't check open box while taking laptop delivery. See below issues that I faced and need your attention so that you save your money.Open box, used laptopI order 14\" laptop and received 15.9\" display.It was getting Heat too much in this cold winter weather.When pressed power switch thrice it turns on.Some times there is black screen and only cursor visible. Twice it happened.Faulty product, was looking like refurbished computer.This seller is selling faulty product. Be aware. It's good to buy from local shop.Configuration is same as described.There are 21% , 1star review;Over all good product, Battery exhaust fast.;The media could not be loaded.It Is Very Ideal For Work And Without Lagging. Very Handy To Use, Feels Like A Book & Is Light. Very Clear Display. Very Satisfied From Amazon. We Were Initially Worried About Quality But It Is The Best By Value.You Can Go For It For Office Working. Used For 4 Hours 100% to 15% In Full Use.;Received my system on 27th February, Completed system configuration, yet to start using.Positive - Received in company (Dell) packing, and Amazon box on top of it, lot of protection inside, brand new piece, verily slim look \u2026 Overall look and feel is Brilliant\u2026Shall write more about performance once I start using itThanks everyone for your attention;I purchased this laptop on the 18th and today is the 24th. I have read a lot of reviews complaining about heating issues and yes they are right. This laptop is a heater. It will be very helpful during the winter season.But I am keeping this as I have liked it and that's why the good 3 stars I am giving.When you use any laptop for the first few days, it heats up pretty badly because of a lot of updates going on in the background. I was almost scared when I see it heats up super bad and was thinking to return it. But that was just one time. But still, it heats up more than a normal laptop should. I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work. I just purchased it as a backup laptop because my main laptop Asus Vivobook runs 14 to 18hrs a day for the last 5 yrs and it needs some rest.Personally, I won't recommend this laptop. Maybe try Asus or HP. Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though. Will update after 4-5 months of usage and re-write proper review after 1 year of usageEdit: 21st August 2024.Well, on 14th August, 2024, laptop stopped working. I sent it to Dell repair and found motherboard is dead. They need to replace it whole.So I am not recommending this laptop. People say right. Never bought expensive stuffs online. This is 4th laptop and 1st online and so huge issue. Motherboard estimation is 16500 right now. Luckily I have insurance, I am not sure how much will they cover. My Asus, HP, Compaq and Macbook never got motherboard issue and all lasted long. This one gave so big issues even from start and now look at it.",

I know this phone looks promising and with that huge discount but please this particular model is trash.I purchased this phone on December 2024 and now today the phone completely died while I was gaming. And the company is denying warranty.;This Phone is definitely worth buying specially for gamers as this phone is a literal gaming beast under budget too, why saying gaming beast because it can handle any games easily cuz of its ram, possessor with snapdragon and the GPU also in the X mode this phone litterely transforms into a beast but this phone beats a lot especially in games like genshin impact of a long session of bgmi or cod with max graphics or other high end games but games like free fire and minecraft and more medium and low end games cuz the phone heating but a less heating but buying a fan for this phone will be a great option for heating problem, also people says that it's good for gaming but bad for normal use but it's false statement as I am using this phone for 4+ months and this phone still works perfectly, the camera, battery life, sound quality, charging are just best than many other phones specially the sound quality and fast charging is literal beast. Also the display is of gorilla glass which is hard, I have dropped my phone for more than 5 times but still no crack. In overall this phone after 4+ months still works like a new one, so if you like it from my comment than this is worth buying;The media could not be loaded.A beast in 35k Range.!! Why GO for other gaming or high performance when you have ASUS ROG?I purchased this phone on 15 Nov,24. First time it did not start at all until I charged it fully which was rather fast.Edit: After 2 months the phone is Dead, warranty says device warranty lapsed on 2022 and i bought it on 2024. Warranty claim issue, the device needs to be taken to Kolkata which is 700km far from my city.Then everything was COOL.*The phone was 12/256 model with USC type-c 3.1 Fast Charge and data support.Air trigger are butter smooth. Mic Quality is also superb.I upgraded my phone from ROG 2 to 5s and the Sound Quality Difference was EPIC. EXTREMELY LOUD.Everything in this Phone is Awsome. Yeah i was little hesitant to buy this from AMAZON but it came good.**Only small issue is when I go select Loudspeakers while in normal call the mic is not able to catch my voice properly in distance that's all in Cons.People who calls this phone bad or something may have issues with their units but as a whole ASUS provides the best product ever, from their Asus ROG Laptops to Phones and everything.;why noise cancellation happens with all video calls, I'm unable to hear my baby voice;Like most;Don't purchase this phone. Over heating and now wifi and hotspot is not working;And want to buy the phone Awesome phone and wonderful display nice phone and coming on the the nice phone;The media could not be loaded.Don't buy this phone suddenly mobile is of while using the phone money waste I want my money back",

I usually run it with battery plugged in so I don't know about the battery backup but if it gives 2-3hour backup than that's enough for me. It comes with a 16amp plug, so you have to buy a socket.Pros:1. Good performance as 4060 is full 140W tgp.2. Ram is in single slot, easy for upgrade.3. Charging adaptor is small considering 240W.4. Looks premium.5. Office 2021 Student included.6. Xbox game pass  for 3 months included.7. It has 2 usb type C.Cons:1. The biggest con is it has only 512gb ssd, not enough for today's AAA titles as they are minimum 60gb per game.2. It has only 2 usb type A port.;I am using this for a week. 4060 works well in almost all games at 1080, Good display, fast charging, 3 - 4 hours battery backup - considering gaming laptop its goodCons:1. Charger you need 16 A socket or connector.2. Speaker not good. I can't play without headset. You should definitely need either extenal speaker or headphones.;Good Laptop..LikesBuild quality and designtried Valorant in high fps,forza horizon,xall of duty - no drop and no heating.Battery backup 4 hrs with gameweight management is also good..heavy nae hai laptopDislike : laptop charger c type hona chaiye hai;Performance is good, but sometimes i have to restart laptop in case to use double touch for zoom, option menu, scrolling...Build quality is better, bit heavy, i would rather put 20k and buy a snapdragon processor laptop from asus, battery bapkup is 3 hours maximum only usage with web on 60 hz, doesn't heat while normal usage, not for music lovers as speakers are not much louder, gaming can be more smooth while using 240 w adapter(on charging);Using since last week.Everything is Good and works perfectly. Recommend this laptop.No fan noise or heating.;Laptop is beast in term of performance but i am really disappointed related my INVOICE of this laptop. Wrong name is written in INVOICE and customer care is also not helping in this case.;The laptop had an opening on top above the camera. Basically the screen and back weren't completely closed. I tried and was able to snap them together.This seem to be a minor issue, and most likely would get fixed by Asus service center, but could have caused major damages if had accidentally pulled on the opening.Also, the charger plug is a 16 Amp (big one), please check your socket availability or buy a convertor (6A to 16A).;Asus Tuf A15. Performance is lovely. Battery life is decent. It is a powerful laptop so I don't really mind the tradeoff. However, keep in mind that Asus ships this with a 16amp plug so it's not very portable. You will need a 16amp to 6amp converter and the 512gb SSD at this price is minor letdown. Overall, satisfied with the laptop",

Overall its superb.Build quality = 9/10Performance = 9.5/10Weight = 10/10Sound quality = 9/10Battery life = 9.5/10Value for money = 9.25/10Will update after couples of months;The best your money could buy the 125H is a very fast processor thermal throttling is less compared to 155h and has great battery life..4-5hours on gaming9hours only browsing7hours on Jawa125 h ultra5 is the best;Product is good but SD or MSD card reader not inbuilt;I bought this laptop recently but I am not quite happy with it. Prior to this laptop, I had MacBook Pro 2015 with Intel Core i5 which lasted so many years. It was a fantastic laptop, fast, stunning battery and built like a tank but unfortunately died recently and it could not be repaired due to unavailability of parts. I had to switch from MacBook just because these days with M series chip Windows cannot be run (not a fan of VMs) which was not the case with Intel Chips that Apple used earlier.I needed a laptop with small screen size, good battery backup, decent processing power and sturdy metal body and preferably non Chinese brand. Asus Zenbook 14 did tick everything on the paper but after using it for few days, I find it\u2019s not as good. The battery isn\u2019t that great, the lid cannot be opened with one hand, it\u2019s almost an empty laptop still I find it\u2019s slower than 2015 MacBook. Excel takes 2-3 seconds to open which otherwise used to open almost instantly on MBP. I am not sure if it\u2019s the laptop or the OS, touchpad is ok but not at par with MBP and it's made in China. Overall not very satisfied. I guess MacBook Air is still a better bet even with VM.;I am writing this review after using the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Ultra 5, for almost two months! Here are some opinions that I feel might help others trying to choose the right laptop for your needs!1. The biggest advantage and comfort of this laptop has been it's unmatched battery backup! Being a researcher, I usually use a lot of powerpoint and word, along with a data analysis softwares. Sometimes I use them the for almost 15hrs straight, and it never occured that I had to keep it on charge or charge the laptop multiple times. One charge to 100% is enough to keep you going for atleast 15-18hrs, which is so relieving!2. The second biggest tick, is the screen quality, the colors are vibrant and the display is super clear, which comes in to handy in keeping you hinged to the laptop. The blue light filter works really good demanding very few instances of wanting to take a break!3. The other feature that comes in handy is the sufficient storage capacity and speed of the processor! You could experience the perks of either of these features on regular usage of the laptop.4. The weight of the laptop, at 1.2Kgs is a relishing takeaway, as it's easy to carry around and work on the go, if needed!5. The only concern is the laptop retains a lot of fingerprint on its screen and surface, which requires you to clean the laptop frequently, almost twice a day!6. The second concern is the camera, the quality gets a little dim., at times. However, once you clean the area of the camera, it does get a little better.7. Another concern that's worth noting is, there's only a single USB socket in the laptop, when you connect the USB of your mouse, you cannot plug in the pendrive, unless it has a type C feature in it! Two USB sockets could be good!If I had to rate it based on my experience, I would say, it's totally worth the buy, as there is nothing much to regret but definitely a lot to relish about!Personally, I would give it an 8/10.",

Full waste of money;Value for Money, Best Build quality , Go for it, Best Display, Best laptop please buy, Best Processor. best in;I purchased an ASUS laptop that was advertised to have a backlit keyboard but didn\u2019t include this feature. Within three days, the laptop started showing defects. After contacting ASUS Service Center, they issued a DOA certificate. However, Amazon refused to accept the return, citing their return policy. Left with no choice, I filed a case with the consumer court. Only after 17 days did Amazon finally accept the return. This experience was highly frustrating and disappointing;My first experience with this laptop:-They scamed me by showing that this laptop contains backlit in their product image, after receiving there was no backlit keyboard.The display quality and build quality is decent(i did run 4k videos from YouTube (it lagged a bit))The performance is good, it does not lag. If you are looking for work/buissness oriented laptop with decent display quality then this is  a good choice. Rest all features are good. I did get ms office lifetime and 1 yr antivirus of mcafee. Over all it's an average laptop. If you are looking for a good laptop with no backlit for coding then this is a good choice. Battery life is good. Weight is 1.6 kg.

                "text": "I've been using this as a personal PC plus a gaming setup given my busy schedule. I've connected this device to Ugreen 9 in 1 dock along with a few other peripherals and this setup feels like a gaming laptop. You can connect this device to most monitors along with an external keyboard and mouse, and voila, you have a fantastic gaming setup even at home. The GPU is almost close to a GTX 1650 with 4gb vram. Modern titles such as Baldurs Gate 3 in Act 3 (the most demanding part of the game) also run reasonably well.The battery life is quite short and I can't fully say that you can expect a full-fledged portable gaming with this, but a couple of hours depending on the load of the game. I was wondering whether to get an ROG Ally X instead of this given the SD card burn issues and poor battery life, but the GPU isn't significantly better on the Ally X. This is the most value-for-money machine as of now. I'm extremely happy with the purchase and delivery from Amazon!The system is working great as now, and I'll update this review further in case I face any issues moving ahead.;The media could not be loaded.The Asus ROG Ally is a fantastic gaming console that strikes a perfect balance between performance and portability. With its powerful AMD Ryzen Z1 processor and high-refresh-rate display, it delivers a smooth and immersive gaming experience, even on the go. The versatility of being able to play AAA titles with console-level graphics in a handheld form is impressive. Its ergonomic design, vibrant screen, and strong battery life make it a top choice for gamers who want the power of a gaming PC in a compact, portable device.;Everything in this tech is top notch for this price range. Rog ally x(Rs 90k) just have a little more performance(+5 fps compared to rog ally) and large battery.But I have received a defective piece, my right button isn't working so I had to return it. Main thing is I was excited to receive a brand new product but cuz of recieving a bad one I had to contact the amazon customer care for 4-5 days to go to asus service center which was far away from my place and they verified the product is defect one (they will provide us with DOA certificate which is required to return). After all I've done roaming here and there they were only able to return the item instead of replacing it.My point is they wasted my money and time. All for nothing. Everything aside the device is just the perfect tech you guys can get(I've played it in first 2 days). Can run many PC game smoothly. Better than many other handhelds.Guess its just my badluck with the seller.;Pros1. Can handle almost all modern games in medium to low settings. Older games can be played at high or ultra settings. Tried Division 2, Doom eternal, nfs etc.2. Can function as a proper windows desktop when connected with a monitor.3. Can serve as a good gaming pc if connected with external gpu.4. Excellent audio quality.5. Display is very crisp.Cons1. Heats quite a bit while playing games.2. Fan noise audible if in a indoor environment.3. Poor battery life if playing in Turbo mode. Hardly 45 mins for demanding games.4. Limited and less storage. Only 500gb and half of that Windows takes. So you are left with installing 3 or 4 modern games.5. Upgrading ssd is expensive as its 2230 slot.6. Risk of frying sd card if used for installing applications.7. Device ergonomics could have been better.8. Biggest Con - Only 1 type c port and no other connection as it also serves as charging port.9. An Oled screen would have better in terms of battery management.If your budget allows go for Ally X. But for me it fulfills all my need as I mostly play on my Xbox or Gaming PC. Overall the best handheld.;I really liked this console. Its powerful and beautiful device. Its windows based. I spent my first day updating the drivers, windows, bios and armoury crate. I started playing the games from 2nd day.The battery life is not very good. I am playing shadow of the tomb raider and I can play the game for 45 mins on battery. But I guess the game is power hungry and I am playing on medium to high graphics so I can get much more battery if I play on low settings.In box content:1. Console2. Information guide3. 65w charging brick4. Xbox ultimate game pass 3 months free trial but need to enter card details to awail this.Downsides:1. Bad battery life. Could've been better.2. I heard that this device fries up the memory card.Good and Best:1. It supports game on high graphics and settings.2. The game looks crisp and smooth.3. I play while charging the console.4. You get around 450gb of sdd to install games. Remaining is used by system. I would be playing one game, uninstall it and install another one.5. Its portable but make sure you have a power source nearby.6. You can play the games offline. I just turned off wifi and the game just works as it is. No extra settings required atleast for Tomb raider.Its a real value for money. I got this device for \u20b938,000. It you are willing to sacrifice on battery and sim card then this is perfect device provided other consoles are more costly starting from \u20b945,000.That's my review for the device. Hit me up if any questions.Thanks for reading this.",

                "text": "Bought the 4070 and Ryzen 9 version.If u r buying for gaming go for it .I been using it for 1 month now .It didn't disappoint.I tested cuple of game's all run very well in max settings.In cyber punk I am getting above 60 fps all settings max and even with path tracing on( with frame gen) if I play with ray tracing max it gets above 80 fps .And in blackmyth wokong i faced minute lag with cinematic preset but runs fine with ultra presetLise of p - about 100 fps in max settingsHorizon forbidden west - 80+ fps in max settingsKingdom come 2 - above 50 avarage with ultra settingsAnd I tried some renders in blender and premier it's really fastI don't recommend for daily carrying it's little heavy and size is also bigBattery backup it not great since it's a gaming laptop;As an avid user of advanced software like Blender and Unreal Engine, I demand a lot from my gaming laptops. The MSI Katana A17 AI not only meets but often exceeds my high expectations in performance. Powered by a Ryzen 7 8845HS and equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, this laptop handles intensive tasks seamlessly without any lag or stutter, a must for graphic design and game development.Battery Life: The battery performance is robust, delivering between 3-4 hours of heavy use and extending up to 5-6 hours for lighter tasks. This is quite impressive for a high-performance gaming laptop, where intensive use usually takes a toll on battery life.Display Quality: The visuals are sharp and smooth on the 44cm FHD display, enhanced by a 144Hz refresh rate which is a boon for gaming and dynamic media consumption. However, the display bezels are on the thicker side, which slightly detracts from an otherwise immersive experience.Speaker Quality: The speakers deliver good audio clarity, enhancing the gaming and multimedia experience. However, they could benefit from a bit more volume to truly match the laptop's overall power and performance.Build and Design: Weighing in at 2.7kg, the laptop is relatively portable for a gaming model. The overall build is sturdy and aesthetically pleasing with a sleek black finish.Room for Improvement: My major gripe is with the size of the display bezels \u2014 a slimmer option would enhance the visual experience. Additionally, the lack of a Type-C charger is a missed opportunity for convenience, especially given the widespread adoption of USB-C for charging and data transfer across devices.Final Thoughts: The MSI Katana A17 AI is a powerful ally for both gamers and professional creators. While it excels in performance, display quality, and audio clarity, a few design tweaks and an update in charging options could make it an unbeatable choice in its category.;Thanks its good product you should buy recommend;This product is a value for money. The physical design is average but the built is very robust. I still have to test out the battery life on the long-run.It's definitely a powerful machine and very suitable for gaming and I have bought this for gaming and CAD tools.. so far it is handling everything I threw at it very smoothly. Would recommend this product.;The media could not be loaded.The only thing you won't regret ever for buying if you love coding, gaming, content creating, etc. Its just simple three words- GO FOR IT!!!  MSI truly understands reasonable pricing for people who want high performance in good value and this is one example. I really suggest you all, go for it.;After a lot of thought, finally got a gaming laptop.And this laptop almost fits what I wanted.This model lacks reviews from reputable sources anywhere online.This was a big and expensive gamble for me.And delivery took 20 days from order date, exactly.So 20 days of warranty loss I guess.Was very disappointed when I saw the delivery dates.Price wise seems to be reasonable I guess, considering a 105W RTX 4060.Never thought 16GB RAM won't be sufficient for modern games.RAM is upgradeable though upto 64GB according to MSI.Wanted to try out and AMD processor after the Athlon 64 days.And I find it zippy considering I am upgrading after 10 years.While playing videos of 720p to 4K, their are many artifacts, hiccups and glitches in hybrid graphics mode.But none of that in discrete graphics mode.Games run smooth and great but the temperatures scares me.CPU and GPU hits 100C while gaming, after which it start slowing everything down and framerates starts dropping.So bought a cooling pad and now max CPU temperatures are 90 and GPU is 90, but the GPU RAM is always 94 and above.The ventilation holes in the bottom panel are very different.None above the fan are provide.Maybe trying to direct airflow through other components before it exits through the cooler.But in winter we can use the exhausts to warm our hands, cuz it gets very hot.2 slots of nvme are their out of which we get 1TB on one slot and the other one vacant, but no mounting hardware is provided.From box to the laptop to the MSI software, everywhere its written for any upgrades consult MSI services center.Sadly their is no MSI service centre in my city.So does that mean I cant perform an upgrade?!For now loving this new laptop after 10 years.Lets see in the long run how it holds up at 90-100 degrees centigrade of thermals.Even on a hill station, at 15\u00b0C of ambient temperature, its running at 90\u00b0-100\u00b0C;This laptop ticks all the boxes to be called as beast. I am using it for last 20 days for my high end software application development. Excellent build qualities. The key boards are very punchy but soft to use. The display is good. Over all its abest purpose I bought it in recent times.",

                "text": "I have bought this laptop recently in sale. The laptop is equipped with a powerful processor so doing editing and daily usage is seamless. The laptop is light weight at 1.8 kg and has a good colour accurate display with ample brightness. I tested two games so far, Forza Horizon 5 and F1 23. I played on ultra settings and got avg 75 fps and temp were at 70-75 degree Celsius max. It comes with Xbox game pass free for 3 months, so I got the games for free. It also comes with lifetime MS office. The built quality is good. The only thik I think needs improvement is the touch pad which seems a bit wobbly if you pay attention.Overall at 71.5k, this is a real good laptop for some one who is looking to play games casually, do advance editing and office/personal work.;Update 21 jan 2025. Broken back cover due to hinge.No action taken by Amazon. So I start using at my home lightly , and 1.5 month did not used as I was out side city.Internal Back cover screw place damaged due to hinge tighteness , kind of manufacturing defect , visited service centre told me 3000-4000 cost , now see under warranty product condition , it\u2019s quite weak laptop, avoid to buy , thnxReview after purchase(old)I purchased an ASUS laptop on October 18, 2024, through Amazon. Just 2-3 days after receiving it, I noticed an excessive heating issue, which prompted me to reach out to Amazon customer care for a return. However, instead of processing the return directly, they suggested that I visit an ASUS service center. Following their advice, I visited the service center, where I received a DOA (Dead on Arrival) approval. ASUS packaged the laptop using their special packing material and instructed me not to tamper with it.On November 1, Amazon scheduled a pickup, but it was rejected because the ASUS-approved packaging  could not be opened for inspection. This led to a series of rescheduled pickups, all of which failed due to the same issue.It\u2019s been a never-ending cycle of rescheduling, calling Amazon multiple times (over 10 calls by now), and dealing with service complications. As a programmer who depends heavily on a functional laptop for work, being left without one has caused immense disruption and wasted valuable time. Both Amazon and ASUS have shown poor coordination and service, making the return process unnecessarily frustrating. If you\u2019re considering buying electronics online, think twice \u2014 this experience has made me question the convenience of online purchases compared to buying from a physical store. I cant say anything about the seller. but issue in amazon pickup policy how they do.;First day the battery backup was  3 to 4 hours for normal workSecond day battery backup was good like it as  above 4 hours backupCons are :-1.Hitsup during heavy tasks In that time battery backup is below 3 hours2. Speekers are not good low volumePros are :-1.Good in multitasking2.Display is also goodIf your are a student go for it;it is best laptop under 70000k battery life 3hr ,wt. 1.8kg, 3050rtx ,13gen ,screen quality is also good;But I see some kind of battery going fast drain sometimes, and sometimes seem to be fine. I don't understand.;Display quality, performance all is good but battery life is horrible.Belive me with mild work like watching YouTube it's battery only lasts for 2.5hour max (on 60% brightness);After using this laptop for just two months, I can confidently say it\u2019s the worst one I\u2019ve ever owned. The issues started piling up almost immediately:Hinge Problems: Within two months, the hinge came loose, making the laptop feel fragile and unreliable.Screen Issues: The screen suddenly went black and became completely unusable, leaving me frustrated and unable to work.Terrible Battery Life: The battery barely lasts 1 to 1.5 hours, which is far below what was advertised.Frequent Freezing: The laptop freezes randomly, interrupting my work and making even simple tasks a hassle.Overall Poor Build Quality: Beyond these issues, the laptop has several other problems, showing a complete lack of quality control.I expected much better durability and performance for the price. Unfortunately, this laptop has been nothing but a disappointment. Save yourself the trouble and look for a more reliable option!;it is good product. it does have a bit of noise in fan . Rest is good. Not very good for heavy gaming. Because it has 55 tgp gpu. It has very good performance for task i have done till now. Heat level did not increased much because i did not do any heavy work or used it for longer session. Right now it has proper build not defect its track pad does not work",

But surprisingly that is not available. As I have urgently need laptop iam just using this without safety.;Average product..Average CPU.. Just 4 cores a d 8 threads. You should get atleast a Hexa core at this price.Expected a atleast an IPS display t this rate.. This is not ideal for any kind of media consumption or games.So the complimentary game pass seems useless.Concerned to install any major apps on this.Build quality and size is good. And design is attractive.Overall the laptop is only good for some normal MS office work... I'm sure it will slow down significantly over time.;Laptop is nice and decent performance for this price range. However, the charger is big 3pin type heavy and bulky.  The charger could have been small and light weight.;Everything as told in the product manual is there. Windows and office comes aling. Display is little bit diasappointing. But later gets used to it.

                "text": "I have bought this laptop recently in sale. The laptop is equipped with a powerful processor so doing editing and daily usage is seamless. The laptop is light weight at 1.8 kg and has a good colour accurate display with ample brightness. I tested two games so far, Forza Horizon 5 and F1 23. I played on ultra settings and got avg 75 fps and temp were at 70-75 degree Celsius max. It comes with Xbox game pass free for 3 months, so I got the games for free. It also comes with lifetime MS office. The built quality is good. The only thik I think needs improvement is the touch pad which seems a bit wobbly if you pay attention.Overall at 71.5k, this is a real good laptop for some one who is looking to play games casually, do advance editing and office/personal work.;Update 21 jan 2025. Broken back cover due to hinge.No action taken by Amazon. So I start using at my home lightly , and 1.5 month did not used as I was out side city.Internal Back cover screw place damaged due to hinge tighteness , kind of manufacturing defect , visited service centre told me 3000-4000 cost , now see under warranty product condition , it\u2019s quite weak laptop, avoid to buy , thnxReview after purchase(old)I purchased an ASUS laptop on October 18, 2024, through Amazon. Just 2-3 days after receiving it, I noticed an excessive heating issue, which prompted me to reach out to Amazon customer care for a return. However, instead of processing the return directly, they suggested that I visit an ASUS service center. Following their advice, I visited the service center, where I received a DOA (Dead on Arrival) approval. ASUS packaged the laptop using their special packing material and instructed me not to tamper with it.On November 1, Amazon scheduled a pickup, but it was rejected because the ASUS-approved packaging  could not be opened for inspection. This led to a series of rescheduled pickups, all of which failed due to the same issue.It\u2019s been a never-ending cycle of rescheduling, calling Amazon multiple times (over 10 calls by now), and dealing with service complications. As a programmer who depends heavily on a functional laptop for work, being left without one has caused immense disruption and wasted valuable time. Both Amazon and ASUS have shown poor coordination and service, making the return process unnecessarily frustrating. If you\u2019re considering buying electronics online, think twice \u2014 this experience has made me question the convenience of online purchases compared to buying from a physical store. I cant say anything about the seller. but issue in amazon pickup policy how they do.;First day the battery backup was  3 to 4 hours for normal workSecond day battery backup was good like it as  above 4 hours backupCons are :-1.Hitsup during heavy tasks In that time battery backup is below 3 hours2. Speekers are not good low volumePros are :-1.Good in multitasking2.Display is also goodIf your are a student go for it;it is best laptop under 70000k battery life 3hr ,wt. 1.8kg, 3050rtx ,13gen ,screen quality is also good;But I see some kind of battery going fast drain sometimes, and sometimes seem to be fine. I don't understand.;Display quality, performance all is good but battery life is horrible.Belive me with mild work like watching YouTube it's battery only lasts for 2.5hour max (on 60% brightness);After using this laptop for just two months, I can confidently say it\u2019s the worst one I\u2019ve ever owned. The issues started piling up almost immediately:Hinge Problems: Within two months, the hinge came loose, making the laptop feel fragile and unreliable.Screen Issues: The screen suddenly went black and became completely unusable, leaving me frustrated and unable to work.Terrible Battery Life: The battery barely lasts 1 to 1.5 hours, which is far below what was advertised.Frequent Freezing: The laptop freezes randomly, interrupting my work and making even simple tasks a hassle.Overall Poor Build Quality: Beyond these issues, the laptop has several other problems, showing a complete lack of quality control.I expected much better durability and performance for the price. Unfortunately, this laptop has been nothing but a disappointment. Save yourself the trouble and look for a more reliable option!;it is good product. it does have a bit of noise in fan . Rest is good. Not very good for heavy gaming. Because it has 55 tgp gpu. It has very good performance for task i have done till now. Heat level did not increased much because i did not do any heavy work or used it for longer session. Right now it has proper build not defect its track pad does not work",

                "text": "Thanks to amazon for giving massive discount on my sbi card during republic day sale which made it possible for me to get this beast. It performs as you think it would.Everything runs buttery smooth but there is battery drop issue i think 230w adapter will fix that aside from that there is not problem and rgb backlight keyboard would have been cool.;As people have mentioned previously, the main issue is due to unavailablity of iGPU which spoils the battery life. Overall a decent laptop and worth the price.I\u2019ll edit my comms after using it for a couple of months;This laptop is an awesome choice for anyone within this budget. I don't think that you can get a better option within this price range. It's pretty powerful and performs great. The display quality is amazing and with a bit of bios tweaking, i managed to squeeze out even more power from this beast. So if you are in a budget, just go for it.;Got it at 71k, faced a screen flickering issue after 2 days but other than that it worths every single penny in terms of display and gaming. It has better display and gaming performance then nitro and victus.;So the best thing about this laptop is that the build quality is sturdy. Do note that this processor has no iGPU so your battery life is limited to 4 hours and does not go higher than that when not plugged in. That being said a friend of mine got the G14 zyphrus and we were gaming at max settings and this laptop did not hit 60 degrees whereas the G14 was touching 85 degrees hence the cooling system is amazing. Another thing I have realised is that I don\u2019t use the laptop when it isn\u2019t plugged in and I do not require 15 -20 hrs of battery life. Also all tasks and jobs run very smoothly on this and I feel its worth the trade off for price and hardware;This lap when fully charged shuts down in just one hour even with usage without the internet. I bought this gaming laptop expecting it's efficiency. But never expected such a low quality battery in such a new age laptop. What is the use of any technology if you can't use it. Imagine you buy a phone with all the latest technology from the top brand but battery dies  in qn 1 hour, will you buy? Even if it's given for free you won't use it. I wonder why companies even make such useless laptops. Horrible experience from Lenovo, never expected. I feel cheated and and have lost 80,000 I paid for this.;So far i am really satisfied with my Laptop. Yes there are some things that could have been better. Like the brightness could have been better. But the colour accuracy and all is good. The build is noce. Speaker quality is good not so bad but could have been better. It is on a heavier side but you know it is a gaming laptop. Many people complaint about the fan noise but i think most of the gaming laptops have this thing. It is just to keep your machine cool you can ignore that. The fan speed can be kept in quiet mode in normal usage. Battery life if you ask me lasted for 2.5-3hrs but i saw a minor charge drop while i was using heavily. 170w charger is not enough. J suggest you contact the customer care and get a 230w one. I bought it for \u20b969k during republic day sale. I think its worth every penny.;Everything is very good but battery is equally bad",

Whether it\u2019s browsing, streaming, or working on multiple applications, everything runs smoothly.\u2714 Speed & Storage \u2013 The 512GB SSD ensures fast boot times and quick application launches. No lags or delays!\u2714 Display & Build \u2013 The 15.6\" Full HD display offers sharp visuals and vibrant colors, making it perfect for work and entertainment. The metal body gives it a premium look and feels sturdy.\u2714 Portability \u2013 At just 1.59 kg, it\u2019s easy to carry around, making it ideal for students and professionals.\u2714 Battery Life \u2013 It provides a decent battery backup, lasting around 6-8 hours on regular usage.\u2714 Windows 11 Experience \u2013 Comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Home, offering a smooth and modern user interface.Overall, this laptop is a fantastic choice for those looking for power, style, and reliability at a reasonable price. Highly recommended! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udcbb;I ordered this laptop during the Great Indian festival season. The price was Rs 32990 but I got it under exchange with my previous laptop.Pros:Full HD 1080p displayLightweight - Though it is 15 inches laptop, it is quite light.RAM - 16 GB single stick with another empty slot (too rare these days to find laptops with RAM card slots).Ryzen 5 5625u - Much better than 5500u as it is based on zen 3 architecture instead of Zen2. I think it is even better than the latest 7000 series of AMD.Cons:1. Keyboard layout - The biggest con of this laptop is the layout of the keyboard. Esp the right shift key. It's really annoying that many times when I wanted to press the shift key, I ended up pressing the right arrow button as both are very close. Most keyboards have a bigger shift key, but in this one the right shift key is smaller than the left shift key. This causes a lot of problems while typing.2. No built in HDD port - While there is space enough to fit a secondary HDD, there is no sata port in the laptop. But may be there is a slot for the sata ribbon on the mother board. You may need to purchase a sata port with a ribbon and fix it on the slot to add another hard disk. I am annoyed as to why acer chose to skip the port when there is space enough for it in the back.3. Display - Though the display size is 39+ cms, I personally feel like it is slightly less than 15.6 inches. I  previously had the lenovo and Dell laptops with 15.6 inches screen and this feels slightly smaller in size compared to them. May be it is because of the thick bezel at the bottom. God!!...I hate bezels.4. No physical shutter for the camera  - My lenovo v15 laptop came with a privacy shutter for the camera. It would come very handy whenever I would be working from home.5. Graphics - My old lenovo ryzen 5 had vega 8 graphics while this comes with Vega 7. Not sure if this is a downgrade but I am ok with it as I dont play games or do any serious video editing.Final verdict - This is a great laptop for the price and although I am quite annoyed about the lack of  internal HDD port and the layout of the keyboard, it is quite a good investment. I especially loved the empty ram slot and was able to fix a 4 Gb card that I had, making it a laptop with 20GB ram.;Pros:-Offer better product compare to other companies in same price. Smooth functioning, good battery life, processor performed well, hd screen gives soothing effect to eyes, very comfortable keypad.Cons-company should provide a laptop bag;Purchased it last year , here's my review for this laptop after using is around 6 months  :-Pros- it's perfect for daily college usage and look premium, battery backup is also pretty good, easy to carry aroundCons- build quality of laptop is not good, you can feel keyboard bending when you press keys so you have to use external keyboardOverall in this price range this is a good laptop;The media could not be loaded.The Acer Aspire Lite AMD Ryzen 3 5300U is a sleek, powerful, and lightweight laptop perfect for work and entertainment. With a premium metal body, vibrant 15.6\u201d Full HD display, and just 1.6 kg weight, it\u2019s easy to carry around. The Ryzen 3 processor, 16 GB RAM, and 512 GB SSD ensure smooth multitasking and fast performance. Pre-installed with Windows 11, it offers a modern, user-friendly experience. Ideal for students, professionals, and everyday users, this laptop strikes a perfect balance between performance and portability. A great value for its prices;The media could not be loaded.I recently purchased this laptop and found it Totally worth the price\u2014great value for money.  Best laptop in this price segment. I bought it for 32000 . You can Go for it! I bought the 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 5 5625U version. The performance is snappy, handling multitasking, research, and content creation effortlessly. The display is sharp, and the keyboard is comfortable for extended writing sessions. Battery life is solid, allowing uninterrupted work. Overall, this Acer laptop is a fantastic investment, striking the perfect balance between power, efficiency, and affordability",

                "text": "i checked with Asus service center as scroll button is not working properly for service. they confirmed this mouse has one year warranty only. Amazon has wrong product info as 3 year warranty , this is cheating and disappointing. this mouse has scroll issues so better think twice before you buy;Silent click response, balanced weight, DPI works great, good thumb grip, Amazing design, never feel tired. Helpful and usable forward and backward buttons. Can connect to 3 screens. No delay at all.Scroll works good until the time u drop it once. Once u drop it, start praying to ur God that scroll works fine.;Okay I will summarise it itpros:1. It feels good on hand, like with it's design it feels good, you won't feel any pain in your hand while using it2. I would suggest getting a mousepad along with it, it'll be good with this mouse, if you also intent for some gaming, and even for professionals you need some comfort, a mousepad with something like a bump on it3. Battery life is good, have been using it for a month or 2 now4. the best part I find in it is that, you can connect 3 devices simultaneously, you'll find a button below the mouse that'll help you change between 3 devices at the same time.5. You'll also be provided with a usb, that'll help you connect the mouse to your pc or laptop, otherwise you can use Bluetooth to connect too6. you can also change the dpi, it has 3 modes , works pretty well between gamescons:1. First of all the scroll wheel, I am not saying that it is bad, scroll wheel in this mouse is pretty solid but, if you intent to use the scroll wheel for gaming , you should probably look for a better one, because the school wheel moves pretty well and also has a unique design, but pressing the scroll wheel between games can be a bit tiringthat;s all, if u r a gamer, and intent to use it for gaming, you must think about it, if your game need the clicking of mouse wheel or not ( i mean clicking not scrolling ) .;Works amazing on laptop,also I tried on mobile it works superb,only drawback I found,the silent button starts making little sound after 2-3 months of usage, overall value for money product;Bought this device 2 months back, Paid premium price of 1600INR but the scroller stopped working in 3 months.The device has a great design, feels good in hands silent too but I guess button to switch between devices should have been given in a more accessible area rather than at the bottom, so if you switch between multiple devices pretty frequently, you will need to lift the mouse and use the button at the bottom of the device.Overall its a good product but considering the fact that you are paying such a premium price if the device stops working in 3 months and then you have to run to service centers to get your mouse fixed is an unnecessary hassle.Maybe I got a bad piece, but that is what it is, now I am running around service centers to have it fixed.;I bought this mouse, at first it felt great but after some days of use the left button seems difficult to click.felt lags sometimes. i tried increasing the DPI still it lags sometime (not a big issues).please read 1 star review and i think those are true. I feel it will stop working. will update the review after 3 months.;I recently invested in the Ergonomic 3 Channel Wireless Mouse for my office and work-from-home setup, and I can confidently say that it has been a total game-changer for my daily productivity. As someone who spends long hours at the computer, comfort and functionality are crucial, and this mouse has exceeded my expectations on both fronts.Let's talk about ergonomics first. The mouse is designed with the user in mind, fitting perfectly into the contours of my hand. The sculpted shape not only reduces strain but also promotes a natural hand position, preventing the discomfort that often comes with extended computer use. The textured rubber grips on the sides provide a secure hold, ensuring that the mouse doesn't slip even during intense work sessions.The wireless functionality is where this mouse truly shines. The 3-channel feature allows me to seamlessly switch between different devices with just the click of a button. Whether I'm working on my desktop, laptop, or tablet, I can effortlessly transition from one device to another without the hassle of reconnecting. This has been a game-changer for me, especially when I need to multitask or attend virtual meetings on different platforms.Setting up the mouse was a breeze. The plug-and-play design meant that I was up and running in a matter of minutes. The wireless range is impressive, providing reliable connectivity even when I'm a bit farther away from my computer. The battery life is equally commendable, lasting for weeks on a single set of batteries. This has not only saved me the inconvenience of constantly changing batteries but also ensures that my workflow remains uninterrupted.The buttons on the mouse are responsive and have a satisfying click, making navigation a breeze. The scroll wheel moves smoothly and has just the right amount of resistance. The adjustable DPI settings allow me to customize the mouse sensitivity to my liking, catering to both precision work and swift navigation.One unexpected feature that I've come to appreciate is the silent clicking mechanism. It might seem like a small detail, but it has made a significant difference during late-night work sessions when others in the house are sleeping. The silent clicks have allowed me to maintain a quiet work environment without sacrificing productivity.In conclusion, the Ergonomic 3 Channel Wireless Mouse has transformed my work experience. Its thoughtful design, seamless wireless connectivity, and impressive battery life make it a standout choice for anyone in need of a reliable and comfortable mouse for both office and work-from-home use. It's an investment in productivity and well-being that I wholeheartedly recommend to fellow professionals.;This is a very cheap quality mouse. Always, its scrolling wheel gets malfunctioned. I have ordered three Asus MW203 (two  from amazon and one from offline). Same issue with three mouse. Though Asus service is good, and they replaced one mouse. But the replaced mouse (4th) also malfunctioned, its scrolling wheel is not working.",

Here's my detailed review:Pros:- Lightning-Fast Performance: The Ryzen 7 7435HS processor handles demanding games and tasks with ease, providing seamless gaming and content creation experiences.- Immersive Gaming: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card delivers stunning visuals, and the 144Hz display ensures smooth gameplay.- Long-Lasting Battery: The laptop lasts up to 6 hours on a single charge (Regular use), making it perfect for long gaming sessions or work trips.- Ergonomic Design: The TUF Gaming A15's rugged design and comfortable keyboard make it ideal for extended use.- Affordable: Considering its specs and performance, this laptop is a great value for money.Cons:- Thermal Management: The laptop can get hot during intense gaming sessions, but the dual-fan design helps keep temperatures in check.- Webcam Quality: The webcam could be better, but it's not a deal-breaker for me.Overall, the ASUS TUF Gaming A15 is an excellent choice for gamers and content creators seeking a powerful, feature-packed laptop without breaking the bank. Its performance, display, and battery life make it a top contender in its class.Recommendation: If you're looking for a reliable gaming laptop with impressive specs, look no further than the ASUS TUF Gaming A15.Rating Breakdown:- Performance: 5/5- Display: 5/5- Battery Life: 4.5/5- Design: 4.5/5- Value: 5/5Would I recommend it?\u00a0Absolutely!;I was sort of worried about Amazon's delivery, but it turned out amazing! The product arrived 2 days early and in perfect condition.Performance is outstanding without a doubt. For the price the 4050 is amazing. Although, min. of 8GB VRAM would have been appreciated but regardless, great deal. Minecraft (all settings max. render distance 16 and BSL shaders) gives 90 - 100 fps easily.Without the iGPU, the battery life does suffer. With normal use (content, office apps etc), you could get around 3 - 4 hours of battery. Heads up: This comes with the big plug (the 16A one they use with ACs and microwaves, so you'd have to install a separate plug for it)The speakers were so bad I couldn't stand using them for 3 minutes. Even with Dolby enabled, it didn't make much difference. I recommend using FxSound which is available on Microsoft Store and makes the speakers much better.The top is made of metal and the overall build is very sturdy. Can't really hold it with one hand for too long but still lighter than flagship gaming laptops.Display is very good indoors but a nightmare outdoors. Colors are amazing on the display though.;The media could not be loaded.Hi guys, Here is my review after using this laptop.Laptop pro's - Design, price and performance.Laptop design - This laptop's design feels premium and nice.Laptop performance - It can handle GTA 5 smoothly. Also can record gameplay.Laptop thermals - Laptop gets hot only during gaming. But it doesn't over heat as far as I used.Laptop con's - I noticed some bugs/glitches like cursor while using in typing area or text box it gets white or kinda invisible I feel this maybe a bug.-Screen goes off for a second sometimes while playing videos or browsing especially in battery power.-Blue screen error: I have faced blue screen error two times till now while switching from power mode to battery mode(plugging out adapter).;The media could not be loaded.I bought an Asus TUF GAMING 15 from amazon on 16/10/2024. After 5 days it had many problems (it suddenly shut down, I thought the battery must have run out, so I charged the laptop and turned it on (it turned on after 5 minutes and the battery was still 40%) and after 1 hour windows crashed and after 1 day windows crashed 3 times, and keyboard light is not working properly ,then I sent it for replacement and AMAZON people said that the tech technician would visit on 27/10/2024 but the technician did not come on the 27th, I contacted Amazon on 1st Nov, they said that your product will be refunded, the DELHIVERY agent will pick up your product on 2nd Nov,\u00a0but they are not picked my product PLEASE REFUND ME MY MONEY;This laptop is worth for playing high level games, and it is super performing in coding, editing,etc...Sound quality are best, think about weight, but it has military grade, having 2050 rtx, not soo bad, if you are thinking for mostly to do more studies work, editing, and less games it may helpful.Heating may occur due to high end level games, make sure to buy any cooling pad, battery according to this laptop is good compared to other gaming laptop, due to its lower graphics card.Charing is must for a better gameplay, editing, or to perform well, and there is a \"battery care mode\" on Myasus app, for reducing heat as well as for best battery longetivity, make sure to on it. Appearance is nice for gamers and having aura blacklit sync!!This review may be helpful for you about this laptop, it is worth as it has ryzen 7 7000 series as other laptops have most cost than this!!Top notch5/5 stars!!!;The media could not be loaded.Best quality,even after 5 hour gaming no Heat ,  display quality is excellent , very smooth, value for money,the only issue is battery \ud83d\udd0b backup is low;Got it for 54,999rs.4 years old hardware and body, renewed with latest SSD, RAM and processorPros:Processor is blazing fastRAM and SSD speed is good ( add 16gb additionally)Keyboard is niceLaptop design is niceUpgradable slots given for both storage and RAMCons:1-1.5hr battery life ( Draining)Heavy weight including charger2021 Old hardware ( mouse pad not good )Laptop build quality not goodAverage GPU (rtx 2050)Not IPS displayWorst speakersHope this helps !",

                "text": "I have been using this Silent Mouse, and it has quickly become my go-to for both work and casual gaming.Pros:\u2022 Quiet Clicks: The silent click feature is a game-changer, allowing me to work in shared spaces without disturbing others.\u2022 Comfortable Design: The ergonomic shape fits comfortably in my hand, reducing fatigue during long sessions.\u2022 Responsive Tracking: The sensor is accurate and performs well on various surfaces, making it suitable for both everyday tasks and gaming.\u2022 Battery Life: The battery lasts a long time, and it uses a convenient USB receiver, eliminating the need for frequent recharging.Cons:\u2022 Limited Customization: While it works great out of the box, advanced users might find the lack of programmable buttons a drawback.\u2022 Size: It may be a bit small for users with larger hands, hence NOT IDEAL for SERIOUS GAMERSOverall, the Asus Silent Mouse is an excellent choice for anyone seeking a quiet, comfortable, and reliable mouse. It combines functionality with a thoughtful design, making it perfect for both office work and casual gaming. Highly recommended!;The ASUS Marshmallow Mouse MD100 Steven Harrington Edition is not just an ordinary wireless mouse; it is a combination of style, performance, and quiet operation. This limited edition mouse, designed in collaboration with artist Steven Harrington, stands out as a unique and fun addition to any tech setup while maintaining solid functionality for everyday use.Design & Aesthetic:What immediately grabs attention is the vibrant, art-inspired design. Steven Harrington\u2019s playful and surreal style is imprinted on the mouse, adding a touch of personality to an otherwise mundane tech accessory. The compact, lightweight build (weighing just 56g) makes it ideal for portability, fitting comfortably into backpacks or laptop bags without adding bulk. The feel in the hand is comfortable, especially for those who prefer smaller mice, and it\u2019s an eye-catching accessory whether you\u2019re at the office or working remotely.Silent Clicks:One of the standout features of the MD100 is its silent operation. The buttons produce virtually no clicking noise, making it a great choice for quiet environments such as libraries, meetings, or late-night work sessions. This \u201csilent click\u201d design delivers the same responsiveness without the distracting noise of a traditional mouse, which can be a game-changer for professionals who share workspaces.Adjustable DPI and Performance:Functionality is where this mouse continues to shine. With adjustable DPI (Dots Per Inch) settings, ranging from 800 to 1600 DPI, users can easily switch between precision tasks (like photo editing) and general browsing or office work. The sensitivity adjustment is a useful feature, allowing for customized control depending on your task or personal preference.The optical sensor is highly responsive across different surfaces, including mouse pads and standard desks. While it\u2019s not a gaming mouse, the performance is more than adequate for general productivity and creative tasks.Multi-Mode Connectivity:The MD100 is versatile when it comes to connectivity. It supports both 2.4GHz wireless (via USB receiver) and Bluetooth, making it compatible with a wide range of devices from desktops and laptops to tablets. Switching between devices is seamless, and the setup process is straightforward. The multi-mode functionality makes it a solid option for users who juggle multiple devices regularly. However, it should be noted that there\u2019s no USB-C dongle included for newer laptops, which is a minor downside.Battery Life:ASUS claims an impressive battery life of up to one year on a single AA battery, depending on usage. For most users, this means the mouse will run for months without needing a replacement. The battery compartment is easy to access, and the mouse features an automatic sleep mode to conserve power when not in use.Ergonomics:Due to its small size, the ASUS Marshmallow MD100 is better suited for users with smaller hands or those who prefer claw or fingertip grip styles. For larger hands or those who require a more ergonomically shaped mouse for long sessions, this might not be the most comfortable option. However, the weight and portability make it a go-to mouse for travel or on-the-go use.Drawbacks:While the Steven Harrington design is a definite plus for those who appreciate artistic collaborations, it might not appeal to those looking for a more minimalist, professional look. Additionally, the lack of an included USB-C adapter could be inconvenient for users with newer devices.Conclusion:The ASUS Marshmallow Mouse MD100 Steven Harrington Edition is more than just a visually appealing gadget. It blends essential features like silent operation, multi-device connectivity, and adjustable DPI into a portable, stylish package. For those seeking a compact, quiet mouse with an artistic flair, this limited edition is a fantastic choice. However, users with larger hands or specific ergonomic needs may want to consider other options.Rating: 4.5/5;Light weight. Good looking. Good tactile clicks. Good size. Fits into my hand very easily. Good texture. Good scroll wheel. Good connectivity options: wifi, bt, usb. Only issue is my mouse turns off all of a sudden and I need to remove the battery and install it again for it to turn back again. Other than this minor inconvenience, good product.;This is an awesome mouse. Great price and great value for money plus good quality. The mouse is sleek, allows me to shift between my laptop and iPad using either radio frequency with an USB dongle or Bluetooth. Connecting and transferring between the two is just a simple flip of a small switch underneath. Very well designed and made.;Must buy, it's beat wireless mouse I have used under this budget, it's very silent, great texture and size.",

                "text": "Bought the 4070 and Ryzen 9 version.If u r buying for gaming go for it .I been using it for 1 month now .It didn't disappoint.I tested cuple of game's all run very well in max settings.In cyber punk I am getting above 60 fps all settings max and even with path tracing on( with frame gen) if I play with ray tracing max it gets above 80 fps .And in blackmyth wokong i faced minute lag with cinematic preset but runs fine with ultra presetLise of p - about 100 fps in max settingsHorizon forbidden west - 80+ fps in max settingsKingdom come 2 - above 50 avarage with ultra settingsAnd I tried some renders in blender and premier it's really fastI don't recommend for daily carrying it's little heavy and size is also bigBattery backup it not great since it's a gaming laptop;As an avid user of advanced software like Blender and Unreal Engine, I demand a lot from my gaming laptops. The MSI Katana A17 AI not only meets but often exceeds my high expectations in performance. Powered by a Ryzen 7 8845HS and equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, this laptop handles intensive tasks seamlessly without any lag or stutter, a must for graphic design and game development.Battery Life: The battery performance is robust, delivering between 3-4 hours of heavy use and extending up to 5-6 hours for lighter tasks. This is quite impressive for a high-performance gaming laptop, where intensive use usually takes a toll on battery life.Display Quality: The visuals are sharp and smooth on the 44cm FHD display, enhanced by a 144Hz refresh rate which is a boon for gaming and dynamic media consumption. However, the display bezels are on the thicker side, which slightly detracts from an otherwise immersive experience.Speaker Quality: The speakers deliver good audio clarity, enhancing the gaming and multimedia experience. However, they could benefit from a bit more volume to truly match the laptop's overall power and performance.Build and Design: Weighing in at 2.7kg, the laptop is relatively portable for a gaming model. The overall build is sturdy and aesthetically pleasing with a sleek black finish.Room for Improvement: My major gripe is with the size of the display bezels \u2014 a slimmer option would enhance the visual experience. Additionally, the lack of a Type-C charger is a missed opportunity for convenience, especially given the widespread adoption of USB-C for charging and data transfer across devices.Final Thoughts: The MSI Katana A17 AI is a powerful ally for both gamers and professional creators. While it excels in performance, display quality, and audio clarity, a few design tweaks and an update in charging options could make it an unbeatable choice in its category.;Thanks its good product you should buy recommend;This product is a value for money. The physical design is average but the built is very robust. I still have to test out the battery life on the long-run.It's definitely a powerful machine and very suitable for gaming and I have bought this for gaming and CAD tools.. so far it is handling everything I threw at it very smoothly. Would recommend this product.;The media could not be loaded.The only thing you won't regret ever for buying if you love coding, gaming, content creating, etc. Its just simple three words- GO FOR IT!!!  MSI truly understands reasonable pricing for people who want high performance in good value and this is one example. I really suggest you all, go for it.;After a lot of thought, finally got a gaming laptop.And this laptop almost fits what I wanted.This model lacks reviews from reputable sources anywhere online.This was a big and expensive gamble for me.And delivery took 20 days from order date, exactly.So 20 days of warranty loss I guess.Was very disappointed when I saw the delivery dates.Price wise seems to be reasonable I guess, considering a 105W RTX 4060.Never thought 16GB RAM won't be sufficient for modern games.RAM is upgradeable though upto 64GB according to MSI.Wanted to try out and AMD processor after the Athlon 64 days.And I find it zippy considering I am upgrading after 10 years.While playing videos of 720p to 4K, their are many artifacts, hiccups and glitches in hybrid graphics mode.But none of that in discrete graphics mode.Games run smooth and great but the temperatures scares me.CPU and GPU hits 100C while gaming, after which it start slowing everything down and framerates starts dropping.So bought a cooling pad and now max CPU temperatures are 90 and GPU is 90, but the GPU RAM is always 94 and above.The ventilation holes in the bottom panel are very different.None above the fan are provide.Maybe trying to direct airflow through other components before it exits through the cooler.But in winter we can use the exhausts to warm our hands, cuz it gets very hot.2 slots of nvme are their out of which we get 1TB on one slot and the other one vacant, but no mounting hardware is provided.From box to the laptop to the MSI software, everywhere its written for any upgrades consult MSI services center.Sadly their is no MSI service centre in my city.So does that mean I cant perform an upgrade?!For now loving this new laptop after 10 years.Lets see in the long run how it holds up at 90-100 degrees centigrade of thermals.Even on a hill station, at 15\u00b0C of ambient temperature, its running at 90\u00b0-100\u00b0C;This laptop ticks all the boxes to be called as beast. I am using it for last 20 days for my high end software application development. Excellent build qualities. The key boards are very punchy but soft to use. The display is good. Over all its abest purpose I bought it in recent times.",

Also supports 12th 13th and 14th intel processors.;Working as expected, 20 days in. Will update in case of any issues.;Budget friendly motherboard with two m.2 slots\u2026 if they provide 5vARGB instead of 12vRGB then its an awesome choice;I dont know if i received a defective product but the socket was broken. One other buyer had reported bent pins. I returned mine and thanks to Amazon the process was smooth albeit with a delay of 3 days per their process which they clearly communicated to me. I will avoid Asus motherboards going forward.;Velu for money under \u20b97500, best performance, 4 sata point, 2 m.2 nvme Gen 3rd slot,2x USB Type 3.0, 4xUSB Type 2.0 port, 1 RGB Header;This motherboard works well with i5 12400 intel processor and Kingston RAM 16gb. The assemble process is simple and minimum configuration. Thank you Asus!;The motherboard us really capable and squeezes everything out of your GPU and CPU. If youre building a midrange PC by which i mean 12100f+GTX 1660 super or RX 6700 its great. But if you'll be building higher end PCs dont cheap out on Motherboard!;I've been using this ASUS motherboard for my latest PC build, and it's been fantastic. The installation was straightforward, and the build quality is top-notch. The BIOS is user-friendly, making overclocking and system tweaking a breeze. It offers great performance and stability, with plenty of connectivity options. Highly recommended for both beginners and experienced builders!;This item arrived with multiple missing components, in fact all that was in the box was the motherboard, a single SATA cable and a software DVD. But the real problem is that someone had put the CPU socket protector back onto the socket incorrectly then forced the tension arm down, completely destroying the CPU socket, making the board totally unusable.Extremely disappointing that what was obviously a returned item hadn't been checked for quality... makes you wonder whether the item I return will go back into circulation for sale.",

                "text": "I came back to x86 after facing some compatibility issues with ARM64 laptops. This one meets all my expectations. The performance is topnotch and battery backup is great too.;Here\u2019s what i\u2019ve learnt in the last two months of owning this. Apart from a few minor snags, the value for money for this level of performance is frankly obscene.Battery life is impressive for a windows laptop, gives a good 8 hours on flights when on whisper mode, battery saver and low brightness. In normal use, 5-6hours. Trickle charges on light use when on a phone power bank, so 24+ hours on a flight with one of those.Speaker quality is crazy, as for some light gaming it\u2019s runs forza high settings 1080p at 90fps. AMD frame generation does help with that, but not by a lot.Soldered ram does not have an upgrade path, but 24GB is quite sufficient. Bottom-firing speakers, with the ai volume boost feature are absolutely killer, but only when placed on a solid tabletop. They are only second to some and not all macbooks in my experience.Screen looks amazing, 3K 120Hz and OLED definitely does not disappoint. Mb pro killer in every way, save the battery life and maybe the speakers.The processor, has an equivalent cinebench score with a ryzen 7800x3d, while consuming a fourth of the power. Similar story with the 890M integrated graphics, comparable opencl score with 3050 mobile. insane.Only drawbacks are the stock m.2 500GB ssd, which can ofcourse be upgraded, and the mediatek wireless card. This isn\u2019t mentioned anywhere enough, it\u2019s absolute garbage. Network drops and funny bluetooth and wifi behaviour is common. To the point i\u2019m considering swapping in the pcie network card with the realtek one from my old laptop, and then changing the nescessary drivers.That and a 2tb kioxia or samsung m.2 drive is all which is needed to convert this laptop to a beast.An amazing buy for me personally, a good upgrade path. No other laptops remotely offered such a price to performance, as of november 2024 when i bought it. It\u2019s a similar scene now in Jan 2025, although that\u2019s bound to change with AMD\u2019s new strix point chips, but those laptops won\u2019t be here for atleast another month. But who cares, my (this) laptop has strix point chips too, the currently leading generation of mobile chips.;I was in doubt about it's built quality. But once I received it I was amazed by its built quality, display quality. One of the best in this segment.;Build quality is really solid. Keyboard feels great to use, OLED screen has top-tier HDR support. Gives me 11 hours of battery life. My only nitpick is that I would've liked a USB-C port on the right side too, so I can put the charger if I need to.;Awesome laptop.Pros:Great display and 16:10 aspect ratio rocks for coding.Really good sound for a portable non mac(with audio boost enabled from asusu settings)Mad cpu performance (beats mac m2 pro!!)Gpu performance is good for igpu. But heating needs to be considered for non whisper modes.AI speakers and mic is magic! Easily removes all background noise from your mic and ALSO FROM THE OTHER SIDE in calls.Cons:Buggy drivers for display. Sometimes might freeze. Poor wifi reception. Weird behaviour of dolby Atmos that it doesn't support effects on bluetooth devices!Tips for best usage in Indian climate:If normal productivity usage, you can use full speed/perf mode plugged in and balanced/whisper mode on battery.If playing games/rendering etc: use whisper mode on battery(gives max gpu performance) and balanced/whisper mode while plugged in.;Really Good build quality;Value for money best performance in the world long lasting battery lightest laptop in the world best sond quality speakers in the world;Great experience in detail of the product and great performance . It is highly recommended for all . Best laptop in this price range",

                "text": "TL;DR Review+ Literally a more compact gaming laptop with controller attached on the side+ Packing very good specs for it's form factor+ Ran and tested the following games: Cyberpunk 2077, Marvel's Spider-Man, The Witcher 3, Deadspace Remake, Days Gone, Elden Ring, GTA V, NFS Payback, Burnout Paradise, Genshin Impact, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1+2 Remake etc - They all work sufficiently well on high graphics settings; exceptions - Cyberpunk 2077, Spider-Man and Deadspace Remake on low~medium settings with FSR on auto gives a fine experience. But again, for a 7-inch screen, you won't notice changes in fidelity unless you're doing a case study on the device.+ Just like a laptop running on battery, the trade off is between framerate and battery-life.+ All in all, in my experience as per my usage, it's a great extension to your pc gaming. If you have to travel a lot and have to stay away from your main gaming pc, this works as a great mini-pc that you can carry wherever you go.Say you're playing Cyberpunk (Steam/Epic/GOG) on your pc, now you have to go to a friend's place/relatives' place for a couple of days, if you have Cyberpunk downloaded on your Ally X from the same client as your PC (Steam/Epic/GOG), thanks to their cloud saves you can carryover your save progress from home pc and continue playing Cyberpunk on your Ally X while at this other place, away from your pc.I love it and definitely recommend it to on-the-go gamers. Cheers and happy hunting!;Don't buy useless product;Let's get cons out first:1. Yes, it's pricey, if you're comparing it with non-handheld consoles. Among handhelds, there's no comparison.2. Feels a little awkward in bigger hands.Now the best part:1. It's damn powerful for what it is, imagine running cyberpunk with medium or high texture and still get above 60fps.2. Even when not on charge, it still goes to 25w tdp, which gives you enough power to run all the games, with ofcourse on the expense of battery life.3. It's still windows, so can be used as daily driver.;The best thing about the ROG Ally X is that it takes everything that the Ally has and makes it better.Unlike something like Steamdeck, you can natively game (without having to rely on cloud gaming) on the Ally X through platforms like Xbox and Steam. What this means is that you can take advantage of price drops of games on any platform or any game store (including Game Pass). You can even install DRM free games on your own, if you want. This freedom in itself is worth the asking price.It's basically a Windows PC, with a really powerful chip and lots of RAM. Do what you want with it. It'll handle everything.;- the additional RAM is a gimmicky upgrade. The gpu memory bandwidth is still unchanged and you are unlikely to see a gain of more than 3-4fps in real world gaming tests- the hardware quality is terrible. All indian units have a wobbly left trigger and it is very common for triggers and dpad to develop a crackling/squeaking sound due to poor manufacturing tolerances. Asus support is a joke as i have experienced- freesync is broken. Most people don\u2019t realise it so to them, I\u2019d say turn off freesync in the amd settings program and then compare. It\u2019s a sham and has minimal impact on such a small screen at low resolutions. You will actually notice smoother gameplay with an fps cap and no freesync at 120hz- software is not abjectly poor but still very bad. Constant hanging of armoury crate and no single consolidated source for driver updates. The myAsus program update my gamepad firmware to a broken version that caused the haptics to remain on constantly. I had to rig the binary files of the old firmware version and trick windows into letting me downgrade.- the 80wh battery is the only proper improvement over the last iteration but the device\u2019s performance even on 25w is only comparable to the steam deck at 16w so pick wisely. You really need to crank up the package power to 30w to get any headroom for the cpu and gpu on this chip so you are effectively only getting 2-2.5 hours of battery on more demanding games.The native landscape display, two usb c ports and extensive support for windows are the major positives of this device compared to the steam deck but the price is obscene. Get some friend or family to pick one up from the US if you must have it. No way is this worth \u20b990k;Great handled console. Which easily can turn to PC, just attach keyboard and screen.Strongly suggest to replace stock SSD with something faster.;At this price I can buy 2 PS5's! Or a medium spec gaming laptop, stretch a little and get a full gaming PC only, what's the point in pricing at 90k!!;Best gaming handheld in market currently! Price wise little hard on pocket.best battery , super ram. Great performance.  Overall a solid device",

I also played efootball 24 and it was also butter smooth.Quality of the product is also really great, it will be slightly on the heavier side but its a gaming laptop so no issues. Appearance is classy and RGB lighting is rare in this price.Display is just like any other display in this price range. It can play 4k videos on YouTube so no issues.Only downside of this laptop at this moment for me is its battery, with i gpu only mode and performance mode turned on, backlight turned off and brightness set to 50 percentage the battery will last for 3 to 5 hours according to you, but remember this is a windows gaming laptop with 85 w tgp rtx 3050 so the battery backup is not bad.Also you will only use a gaming laptop by plugging in. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GAMING LAPTOP THEN GO FOR IT, IF YOU WANT A LAPTOP WITH HIGH BATTERY LIFE THEN LOOK SOMETHING ELSE, ALTHOUGH I PREFER THIS LAPTOP. NO OTHER ISSUES WITHIN 3 DAYS OF PURCHASE, IF SOMETHING HAPPENS I WILL EDIT MY REVIEW;The media could not be loaded.First of all laptop was delivered in amazing condition and delivery was smooth, i have been using this laptop from past three months and this thing is amazing, really if you want a budget laptop with amazing performance this is the one for you;The media could not be loaded.over all laptop is good in condition. Budget friendly, brightness and sound quality is far better in this budget range. Performance is great. Battery life and size is same as mentioned.;This is a review after using it for 4 months. I bought this on May during a sale for around 49k(including prime members offer and credit card deduction).. At this price... It  is impossible to get a laptop of this spec... Definite value for money, other than laptop display wobbling no other quality concern... Heats a little bit but it's common in all gaming laptops..ps get a cooling pad...Overall 5/5Amazing purchaseWould recommend\ud83d\udc4d;i purchased it for 63k in Oct 2023and got a good deal on 8 gb ram from crucialso roughly 65.5k for 16gb variant, which was extremely great deallaptop is fast, powerful and snappy for any of my tasksthis is a budget gaming machine so expect all those features and drawbacks;bought it at 57k , honestly its a goddam steal;I was upgrading the ram and ssd, when I tried opening the back cover, the paint on all the screws was little off and they were scratched (happens only when it's already opened before) and one of the screw was damaged and the the there were scratch on the body as well.These kind of specs at this price point is to good to be true, if you see Ryzen 7 6800h processor laptops they generally starts from 85k-90k , This laptop is replaced with the used hardware and they're selling it for quite lower price as compare to their competitors. Consider extending your budget and get a good rated laptop.Being a reputed  brand lenovo should take care of this thing.Very bad experience buying this laptop.;The media could not be loaded.Ok \ud83d\udc4d it's good",

                "text": "Bought the 4070 and Ryzen 9 version.If u r buying for gaming go for it .I been using it for 1 month now .It didn't disappoint.I tested cuple of game's all run very well in max settings.In cyber punk I am getting above 60 fps all settings max and even with path tracing on( with frame gen) if I play with ray tracing max it gets above 80 fps .And in blackmyth wokong i faced minute lag with cinematic preset but runs fine with ultra presetLise of p - about 100 fps in max settingsHorizon forbidden west - 80+ fps in max settingsKingdom come 2 - above 50 avarage with ultra settingsAnd I tried some renders in blender and premier it's really fastI don't recommend for daily carrying it's little heavy and size is also bigBattery backup it not great since it's a gaming laptop;As an avid user of advanced software like Blender and Unreal Engine, I demand a lot from my gaming laptops. The MSI Katana A17 AI not only meets but often exceeds my high expectations in performance. Powered by a Ryzen 7 8845HS and equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, this laptop handles intensive tasks seamlessly without any lag or stutter, a must for graphic design and game development.Battery Life: The battery performance is robust, delivering between 3-4 hours of heavy use and extending up to 5-6 hours for lighter tasks. This is quite impressive for a high-performance gaming laptop, where intensive use usually takes a toll on battery life.Display Quality: The visuals are sharp and smooth on the 44cm FHD display, enhanced by a 144Hz refresh rate which is a boon for gaming and dynamic media consumption. However, the display bezels are on the thicker side, which slightly detracts from an otherwise immersive experience.Speaker Quality: The speakers deliver good audio clarity, enhancing the gaming and multimedia experience. However, they could benefit from a bit more volume to truly match the laptop's overall power and performance.Build and Design: Weighing in at 2.7kg, the laptop is relatively portable for a gaming model. The overall build is sturdy and aesthetically pleasing with a sleek black finish.Room for Improvement: My major gripe is with the size of the display bezels \u2014 a slimmer option would enhance the visual experience. Additionally, the lack of a Type-C charger is a missed opportunity for convenience, especially given the widespread adoption of USB-C for charging and data transfer across devices.Final Thoughts: The MSI Katana A17 AI is a powerful ally for both gamers and professional creators. While it excels in performance, display quality, and audio clarity, a few design tweaks and an update in charging options could make it an unbeatable choice in its category.;Thanks its good product you should buy recommend;This product is a value for money. The physical design is average but the built is very robust. I still have to test out the battery life on the long-run.It's definitely a powerful machine and very suitable for gaming and I have bought this for gaming and CAD tools.. so far it is handling everything I threw at it very smoothly. Would recommend this product.;The media could not be loaded.The only thing you won't regret ever for buying if you love coding, gaming, content creating, etc. Its just simple three words- GO FOR IT!!!  MSI truly understands reasonable pricing for people who want high performance in good value and this is one example. I really suggest you all, go for it.;After a lot of thought, finally got a gaming laptop.And this laptop almost fits what I wanted.This model lacks reviews from reputable sources anywhere online.This was a big and expensive gamble for me.And delivery took 20 days from order date, exactly.So 20 days of warranty loss I guess.Was very disappointed when I saw the delivery dates.Price wise seems to be reasonable I guess, considering a 105W RTX 4060.Never thought 16GB RAM won't be sufficient for modern games.RAM is upgradeable though upto 64GB according to MSI.Wanted to try out and AMD processor after the Athlon 64 days.And I find it zippy considering I am upgrading after 10 years.While playing videos of 720p to 4K, their are many artifacts, hiccups and glitches in hybrid graphics mode.But none of that in discrete graphics mode.Games run smooth and great but the temperatures scares me.CPU and GPU hits 100C while gaming, after which it start slowing everything down and framerates starts dropping.So bought a cooling pad and now max CPU temperatures are 90 and GPU is 90, but the GPU RAM is always 94 and above.The ventilation holes in the bottom panel are very different.None above the fan are provide.Maybe trying to direct airflow through other components before it exits through the cooler.But in winter we can use the exhausts to warm our hands, cuz it gets very hot.2 slots of nvme are their out of which we get 1TB on one slot and the other one vacant, but no mounting hardware is provided.From box to the laptop to the MSI software, everywhere its written for any upgrades consult MSI services center.Sadly their is no MSI service centre in my city.So does that mean I cant perform an upgrade?!For now loving this new laptop after 10 years.Lets see in the long run how it holds up at 90-100 degrees centigrade of thermals.Even on a hill station, at 15\u00b0C of ambient temperature, its running at 90\u00b0-100\u00b0C;This laptop ticks all the boxes to be called as beast. I am using it for last 20 days for my high end software application development. Excellent build qualities. The key boards are very punchy but soft to use. The display is good. Over all its abest purpose I bought it in recent times.",

Amazon has wrong product info as 3 year warranty , this is cheating and disappointing. this mouse has scroll issues so better think twice before you buy;Silent click response, balanced weight, DPI works great, good thumb grip, Amazing design, never feel tired. Helpful and usable forward and backward buttons. Can connect to 3 screens. No delay at all.Scroll works good until the time u drop it once. Once u drop it, start praying to ur God that scroll works fine.;Okay I will summarise it itpros:1. It feels good on hand, like with it's design it feels good, you won't feel any pain in your hand while using it2. I would suggest getting a mousepad along with it, it'll be good with this mouse, if you also intent for some gaming, and even for professionals you need some comfort, a mousepad with something like a bump on it3. Battery life is good, have been using it for a month or 2 now4. the best part I find in it is that, you can connect 3 devices simultaneously, you'll find a button below the mouse that'll help you change between 3 devices at the same time.5. You'll also be provided with a usb, that'll help you connect the mouse to your pc or laptop, otherwise you can use Bluetooth to connect too6. you can also change the dpi, it has 3 modes , works pretty well between gamescons:1. First of all the scroll wheel, I am not saying that it is bad, scroll wheel in this mouse is pretty solid but, if you intent to use the scroll wheel for gaming , you should probably look for a better one, because the school wheel moves pretty well and also has a unique design, but pressing the scroll wheel between games can be a bit tiringthat;s all, if u r a gamer, and intent to use it for gaming, you must think about it, if your game need the clicking of mouse wheel or not ( i mean clicking not scrolling ) .;Works amazing on laptop,also I tried on mobile it works superb,only drawback I found,the silent button starts making little sound after 2-3 months of usage, overall value for money product;Bought this device 2 months back, Paid premium price of 1600INR but the scroller stopped working in 3 months.The device has a great design, feels good in hands silent too but I guess button to switch between devices should have been given in a more accessible area rather than at the bottom, so if you switch between multiple devices pretty frequently, you will need to lift the mouse and use the button at the bottom of the device.Overall its a good product but considering the fact that you are paying such a premium price if the device stops working in 3 months and then you have to run to service centers to get your mouse fixed is an unnecessary hassle.Maybe I got a bad piece, but that is what it is, now I am running around service centers to have it fixed.;I bought this mouse, at first it felt great but after some days of use the left button seems difficult to click.felt lags sometimes. i tried increasing the DPI still it lags sometime (not a big issues).please read 1 star review and i think those are true. I feel it will stop working. will update the review after 3 months.;I recently invested in the Ergonomic 3 Channel Wireless Mouse for my office and work-from-home setup, and I can confidently say that it has been a total game-changer for my daily productivity. As someone who spends long hours at the computer, comfort and functionality are crucial, and this mouse has exceeded my expectations on both fronts.Let's talk about ergonomics first. The mouse is designed with the user in mind, fitting perfectly into the contours of my hand. The sculpted shape not only reduces strain but also promotes a natural hand position, preventing the discomfort that often comes with extended computer use. The textured rubber grips on the sides provide a secure hold, ensuring that the mouse doesn't slip even during intense work sessions.The wireless functionality is where this mouse truly shines. The 3-channel feature allows me to seamlessly switch between different devices with just the click of a button. Whether I'm working on my desktop, laptop, or tablet, I can effortlessly transition from one device to another without the hassle of reconnecting. This has been a game-changer for me, especially when I need to multitask or attend virtual meetings on different platforms.Setting up the mouse was a breeze. The plug-and-play design meant that I was up and running in a matter of minutes. The wireless range is impressive, providing reliable connectivity even when I'm a bit farther away from my computer. The battery life is equally commendable, lasting for weeks on a single set of batteries. This has not only saved me the inconvenience of constantly changing batteries but also ensures that my workflow remains uninterrupted.The buttons on the mouse are responsive and have a satisfying click, making navigation a breeze. The scroll wheel moves smoothly and has just the right amount of resistance. The adjustable DPI settings allow me to customize the mouse sensitivity to my liking, catering to both precision work and swift navigation.One unexpected feature that I've come to appreciate is the silent clicking mechanism. It might seem like a small detail, but it has made a significant difference during late-night work sessions when others in the house are sleeping. The silent clicks have allowed me to maintain a quiet work environment without sacrificing productivity.In conclusion, the Ergonomic 3 Channel Wireless Mouse has transformed my work experience. Its thoughtful design, seamless wireless connectivity, and impressive battery life make it a standout choice for anyone in need of a reliable and comfortable mouse for both office and work-from-home use. It's an investment in productivity and well-being that I wholeheartedly recommend to fellow professionals.;This is a very cheap quality mouse. Always, its scrolling wheel gets malfunctioned. I have ordered three Asus MW203 (two  from amazon and one from offline). Same issue with three mouse. Though Asus service is good, and they replaced one mouse. But the replaced mouse (4th) also malfunctioned, its scrolling wheel is not working.",

Powerful i9 (20threads)- so handle multitasks like peice of cake2. 16gb DDR5 - r/w speed 4800Mhz - context switch is pretty smooth & fast!!3. 1tb ssd- faster access & hell lot of storage (unless you've tons of movies, study materials;)4. OLED Display is the USP of S15. I use it for almost 14hrs/day but cuz of eye protection mode, blue light shield & other stable parameters I don't feel any strain in my eyes\ud83d\udc40\u27285. High battery capacity of 75Whr. It's Intel EVO so battery life is easily 8-10hrs I get. Supports fast charging. It takes max to max 2hrs for full charge (from 15 to 100%).6. Light weight so feels quite handy.7. Full keypad (backlit), huge trackpad + touch unlock(win hello feature), strong wifi 6E.8. Awesome sound s/m by Harman/kardon(atleast better then prev versions) + Dolby Atmos\ud83c\udfb69. Pre-installed win 11 + Life time Ms office21 + (extra 2yrs warenty extension offer at \u20b9999).10. No heating issue at all!! (Idk why People complaining about too much heating.. I use it for almost whole day with extensive cpu bound tasks but doesn't felt heat even for single time. While charging also it doesn't heatup much. I'm sure these people either would have playing graphics intensive games on this laptop or doesn't know how to handle a device efficiently). Also it is equipped with extreme cooling mechanism.11. I didn't knew that latest Intel iris xe graphics handles visualization tools & ML projects efficiently.12. Strong built (as it claims military grade tested\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb)13. Boot time is super quick ~ 2-3sec (ofc due to Intel EVO)14.

Cuz i9 H-series is never possible under 1Lakh & Intel EVO laptops are only for premium top-notch devices!!;Overall it's an awesome Laptop. Points I loved in it...1. Performance - Very smooth and quick processing. It didn't take me much time to set up and install new softwares in this laptop. The processing was super fast. Even the start up and shut down of the laptop is done in seconds. I used and i5 processor before this and in comparison to that I feel this is 10 times faster. Really impressed and mind blown with the performance. 5 stars for just the performance2. Value for money - I got this Laptop for approx 85k and then card discount and cashback brought it down to 79k. At this rate, this laptop was an excellent deal.3. Battery life - Though I have not used it much till now, but I used it around 4 hours in which I watched some videos, surfed the net, did some data processing work and installed new softwares. Even then 50% of the battery was still left.4. Display - Though it's not on OLED display but a FHD, even then the display is crisp and clear. I liked it5. Features - The laptop comes with a seperate copilot feature in the taskbar. There's a slidex feature which helps to connect mobile to the laptop. I am still discovering the other features inbuilt in the laptopFew points you feel could have been better1. Speakers - The speakers are placed at the bottom and are not very loud but it's not a deal breaker. The sound quality and output is reasonable and clear.2. Keyboard layout - The keyboard layout has been tinkered with in this model. In the Numpad, the position of the zero and decimal button are interchanged. So it happened many times with me that instead of pressing zero, I pressed decimal. The Enter button is usually twice the size of the other numpad buttons but here it's the same size. So you have to kind of get used to it. Also the Num lock button does not have a light on it. So you don't know whether the Numpad is on or off.;After 2 weeks of purchase iam writing this review Battery backup is good, performance is also good no lags,but sometimes fingerprint sensor is not capturing.with 65w charger around one and half an hour it is full charged.spekaers also good but not loud.;Worst product don't buy this.

Battery lasts for almost a day with average use;I had been using this more than a month now for Full Stack development, I cant be more  happy than this, got the beast only for 80k, Its too cheap to get i9 13th gen in this budget, first i thought Its having some problem, but since day 1 perfomance had been top notch, I thought there will be heating issue but I havent found it, neither any sound of fan so far.I always use laptop connected to power (which is recomemded) so cant say anything about battery life, but if possible we should always pefer using any laptop connected to power instead of charging and discharging every now and then which reduces battery life.My last Asus i5 lasted 7years daily 9am-911pm lets see with this i9, fingers crossed.;What's ok: 15.6\" Oled display, build, decent specifications, sound, cooling, key stroke.What's not: Numeric keypad has very small size Enter key, safety orange colored ESC key is an eyesore, some bloatware, non-expandable RAM.",

                "text": "The media could not be loaded.Very fast processing, great for progamming and development. My major use case is programming and development. For SpringBoot development it can manage easily running simultaneously 5-6 Intellij Idea Ultimate springboot applications, Docker engine running more than 5 containers, MySQL server, MongoDB server, postman, notepad++,10-12 chrome tabs with two tabs playing video at 1080p or more and with all these applications CPU usage never cross more than 15% and any if these applications ever hang. Only issue is with RAM shortage which crosses 90% but that depends only on one's personal usage and moreover it can be upgrade to 32GB(5600Mhz DDR5).Pros: 1. Very fast CPU2. Even though CPU is best in laptop segement the display is the best feature. 2k resultion 240Hz 3ms3.  Laptop body feels like metallic not sure about the material. bottom part is hard plastic and of very sturdy build. Hinges are also very strong.4. Games i've played are only NFS heat and Valorant. with highest ultra settings(2k) i'm getting 130FPS and 200+ fps respectively. For valorant if playing with medium setting in 1080p it crosses 500+fps. It is good in a laptop segment. Temprature peak upto 73C (15C room temperature)5. We can optimize the GPU usage and CPU usage, how many Cores we need, everything can be optimized as per our usage.Cons.1. Battery backup is the issue. It can be used upto 3+ hrs with optimal settings.2. RAM is less for certain taks. It can be upraded but it should be 32 GB for this price point.3. Power cord is 16A, so you will need a 16A socket to charge it or you've to buy a convertor.To summarize above points, this is a great buy if you only want a LAPTOP, becuase with 2 lakhs you can build a decent PC with better specifications. I needed a laptop as i travel alot but otherwise i would have opted for PC build. I checked the price with showroom, amazon is cheaper but you'll not get any laptop bag or free accessories even keypad protector is not provided.;ASUS has by far been the worst company I have had experience with. My laptop got issues 3 times during ita warranty. But they were not able to diagnose the issue. And now im stuck with this useless expensive machine all my life.2 lakhs is a total waste on this product.Please dont buy.;(Review has been updated on Fri, 6 dec 2024, see at bottom)So i purchased this laptop on 23 November 2023 and it got delivered to me on 26 November 2023. And this is my first gaming laptop.Let's talk about upgradability first (from what i experienced)1) RAMRam can be upgraded to 64gb, it came with 2x8gb ram sticks then i bought the 32gb ram and replaced with one of those 8gb ones, now my laptop running with 40gb ram without any problem. I bought the same frequency ram as stock ones 4800 mhz. I wasn't sure if 5600 mhz ram will work at it's full speed, so i didn't take any chances but after so many research i found out that the max speed you can run is 5200 mhz with the latest bios, though you have to enable it through bios.And you can upgrade the ram upto 64gb, better to look at Intel's official site for your specific processor for the max ram support.2) STORAGEIt has 2 slots, laptop initially came with 1TB micron ssd, so i purchased another 1TB ssd of crucial company (parent company is micron). You can use any company of ssd you want, it doesn't matter. I'm not sure if you can fit 2tb in each slots the max upgrade i can confirm is 2tb by combining both slots.You can also upgrade your wifi card as well.3) DESIGN, BUILD QUALITY AND FEELLoved the design of this laptop,and great build quality. it has a combination of premium plastic and alluminium. It has aluminium back panel, a glass touch pad. You can lift up the panel with one hand without holding the laptop with another hand. Keyboard has a little flex typical for laptops but looks really good with rgb on but it lacks the visibility of letters written on the keys when you turn off the rgb, only 4 keys are highlighted with white colour W, S, A and D, other than these four keys, rest keys are solely dependent upon rgb lights underneath it.4) DISPLAYI play games and do other works at 1200p (the best resolution for this 16\" inch QHD+ display  size in my opinion). Even though the laptop has QHD+ screen, trust me 1200p for that size of a screen is the best way to juice out the best performance while maintaining the quality, you won't notice a difference in picture quality, yup 1600p will surely give more sharper results. Suppose if you are watching any content or doing stuffs like  photo editing or doing photo/video editing, then you'd want the picture quality to the best your laptop can provide then set your display  resolution to 2560*1600p. The display is amazing it produces sharper images and rich colours all thanks to 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut, it covers more colour range than of 100% sRGB. You will fell in love! So for me 1200p is a sweet spot for gaming and other work in a 16\" QHD laptop.You can enjoy the HDR contents! with Dolby vision & atmos, totally takes care of your entertainment side.5) PERFORMANCEI personally like to play games at 1200p, there's like 20-30% difference in picture quality between 1200p and 1600p so it really doesn't matter, i wanted performance without loosing the picture quality. The performance difference is huge between above mentioned resolution. I suggest you play games at either silent mode or manual mode. The silent mode doesn't let your cpu go too hot means it stays on and below 86\u00b0C whatever you do, however your cpu intensive games could become laggy. In manual mode your laptop becomes power hungry better plug it and play. It will give you the max performance.  To get better temps you can adjust power limits  and crank up the fans a bit btw all these settings are adjustable in armoury crate app.The following  games I played at 1200p and screw refresh rate was set to 240 hz (oh man it's butter smooth) and in manual mode in armoury crate ( with latest bios 321 as of Friday 22 December )Assassin's  Creed Odyssey - Maximum settings - 100 fps - max temp 96\u00b0C & low 86\u00b0C - manual modeBattlefield 5 - max settings - ray tracing off - 140 fps - max temp around 95\u00b0C and low 87\u00b0CBattlefield 2042 - max settings - ray tracing off - 100 fps - temps same as aboveCyberpunk 2077 - max settings - ray tracing off - 70 fps - max temp 97\u00b0C & low 90\u00b0CTill now i play these games only, will update  later.6) My OpinionIt's fulfilling my needs so i have no complaint. I bought this for casual gaming, photo editing & graphic designing, 3d rendering & animation and video editing.This in my opinion is the best rtx 4060 graphics card laptop under 2 lakh. It has the latest RTX 4060 sa  that it's only 8GB but it's better than last gen's RTX 3060 in many ways, yes not a huge upgrade, better wait for 2 more years for rtx 5060 to come if you can. It has QHD screen, 240hz refresh rate with 3 ms screen response time, Dolby Vision & Atmos support, HDR support, 100% DCI-P3, 100% sRGB, AND 75% Adobe RGB, and G-Sync. That's more than enough for me, this beast is filled with features worth every penny.And FINALLY! it has the flagship laptop processor of the year the i9-13980HX !7) LIQUID METAL!?Asus claims it reduces temp upto 10\u00b0 more than normal thermal paste. I don't have a lot to tell about this but somewhere i feel like it is doing it's magic.8) CONS (maybe)It heats a lot but laptop tends to heat a lot. What would you expect with such a tiny beast having 24 cores with a compact design. As someone said in the comment section that it is recommended to use the laptop in an air conditioned room to keep it cool but even in the coldest season the place where i live the temps go as low as 10\u00b0c at night, and in that temp, this laptop still reaches 95\u00b0C in perfomance mode and in manual it even touches 100\u00b0C (only 10% of the time) sometimes, good thing is it doesn't stay on the same temp for more than a second the average i would say is 93\u00b0C.I don't know if it's with my unit only ( BIOS version 321). Other than this it has another bug which is regarding brightness, you can't control brightness through keyboard, the brightness button provided on the keyboard doesn't work, I assume that it is probably a bug.Will upload more photos later for this review.***Update after an year of use***Let me tell you something, this piece has not given any problems even after a whole year, I've not used it so intensively and condition may vary for others but I've used it moderately.Yup asus have been failed to fix the brightness button problem even after an year and in a one year  time span i almost got 4 BIOS update. Asus gives frequent softwares and driver updates which is absolutely a good thing for the laptop.Recently I've been playing Uncharted 4, everything was running smoothly at ultra settings on 1200p, haven't seen any performance issue after one year of use so I'd give it 9/10.Battery life ? I rarely run my laptop on battery power so can't say about this but haven't got any bettery related issues yet. working fine. I always use my laptop when it's plugged in. (It's generally for gaming laptops)Another good thing is that this laptop has very amazing dust filters, but still you should clean your laptop Every 3 months if you are moderate user like me, but if you are a heavy user I'd recommend cleaning every one and a half months. I use toothbrush and blower to clean it. Don't worry, there won't be any short circuit while cleaning as you open the back  the battery gets disconnected automatically it has a senser, how amazing isn't it.I might update sooner if i run into any problems or just for a quick update.Thanks for reading!;Worthy product, useful to gamers;It's absolutely amazing. The display is gorgeous and pretty color accurate from factory as long as you're using the calibration that GameVusual applies. Personally I just calibrate everything myself anyway but the factory calibration is pretty solid.CPU performs as it should and can sustain 30k-31k cinebench r23 @100w with custom fan curve.GPU overdelivers. Got a blender benchmark (v3.6) score of 3800+I had bought an Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 with an i9 14900hx and 4070. The Asus outperforms the CPU by 20-25% and the GPU is only 12% worse for my workloads. The main issue with Acer i had was their predator sense software which made the PC unusable. That software defaults to balanced mode after each reboot with external display and AC power connected which throttles CPU and GPU to extremely low power which makes everything 60% slower. So even even the AC is plugged in, the software goes to balanced mode and the predator sense app glitches out and the only way to fix that is to reinstall PS and some IO drivers but that only lasts till I reboot.Acer customer support got remote access to my PC twice and couldn't fix it. I even formatted the whole system (btw windows installation won't detect the SSD, beware) and even that didn't fix the issue. I returned that and bought this Asus and it's wonderful.",

I think AMD ryzen 7 has less max temp. hp omen 16 has that but it is 15K costlier.2. While gaming if there is a power cut, the laptop is getting switched to silent mode from turbo mode immediately because of which games face a sharp fps drop and you have to close the game as fans are now off. There should be some configuration of, say 2-3 minutes in which the fans will run using battery power so that you can save the game at checkpoints.3. MS office they should provide.4. SSD is only 450 GB usable.;I recently purchased this laptop, and while it has some good features, there are a few issues to consider.**Pros:**- **Lightweight Design**: The laptop feels lightweight due to excellent weight distribution.- **Good Battery Life**: Battery performance is better on Windows 11 compared to Ubuntu.- **Stable Keyboard**: The keyboard is stable and provides a good typing experience.- **Large Trackpad**: The trackpad is spacious, though it can lead to accidental cursor movements.- **Effective Ventilation**: The cooling system is efficient, and I didn\u2019t notice any fan noise.- **Better Webcam**: The camera quality is superior to many other laptops.**Cons:**- **OS Crashing Issues**: I experienced OS crashing shortly after purchase.- **Display Quality**: The display is not as sharp as I expected and feels a bit dull compared to my desktop monitor.- **Bulky Adapter**: The power adapter is quite large and cumbersome.- **Limited USB Ports**: There are only two USB-A ports, which can be restrictive if you need to connect multiple devices. However, it does include a Thunderbolt and a USB-C port.**Conclusion**: Overall, this laptop has its strengths and weaknesses. If you\u2019re considering a purchase, be mindful of the OS issues, display quality, and limited USB ports. However, the lightweight design and decent camera quality are definite advantages.;I ordered an ASUS TUF F15 (FX507VV-LP287W) laptop from Amazon, expecting a hassle-free purchase experience. However, I was extremely disappointed when I received a defective unit with severe screen bleeding issues and a physical bump near the keyboard.I immediately requested a replacement within the DOA period (Dead on Arrival policy) on January 29, 2025. Amazon scheduled a technician visit on February 3, 2025, who confirmed the issue and initially assured that a replacement would be processed. But later, Amazon support refused to help and redirected me to ASUS, leaving me stuck between both companies with no proper resolution.Despite multiple follow-ups with both Amazon and ASUS, I was denied a DOA certificate, and now I\u2019m being forced to visit a service center for a repair on a brand-new laptop\u2014which is completely unacceptable. A friend of mine had a similar issue with HP, and they replaced his laptop without any hassle, but Amazon and ASUS have been making me go in circles.Amazon\u2019s return and replacement policy for expensive electronics is misleading, and their support team keeps redirecting customers instead of resolving the issue. This has been a horrible experience, and I will think twice before making a high-value purchase from Amazon again.If you are considering buying a laptop from Amazon, be aware that their return and replacement policies are unreliable! I will be escalating this issue through consumer forums and PG Portal if it is not resolved soon.;Awesome battery life as per a gaming laptop, killer performance when plugged in. This heats up a bit, as it's a lightweight gaming laptop ( while full fledged gaming laptops weighing 2.6 kg, it's 2.2 kg ), but never seen a performance drop because of heating. Just use a cooling pad or lift it up a bit while gaming.As per a gaming and productivity laptop, must recommend. RTX 4060 is a beast and combined with i7 13620h, can handle any AAA title at max to high settings at 50-70 fps....Just go for it while at 95k;Value for money. Very good for games and graphic design.;just go for it,, genuine product;The media could not be loaded.First of all track pad was not working from corners \ud83d\ude15 sound quality is very poor and my volume button was not working weight was decent 2.1 kg size was normal but it has screen flickr issue I attached a video of it I have like 3 videos of different issues like mouse flicker , keyboard randomly stops working manyy problems so I called technician he delayed his work 3 days for by that my policy expired 7 days replacement so I contacted Amazon for that and they responded great and gave me free refund but wait time is too long like 15 days they sayNow I will buy from reliance digital it has amazing offers and insurance and Warranty of its ownPlease buy offline \ud83d\ude2d;Beast Gaming Laptop. Nothing To Say Muchmore About Gaming Performance Is Really Great And Screen Quality Is Superb That\u2019s It",

So the quality and reliability here should not be questioned anyday.The mouse is silent with compact design with adjustable dpi (upto 1600). By default it is set to 1000dpi. The clicks are little bit stiff. It has optical sensor unlike cheap 1000rs set of keyB n Mouse.This mouse is way better than Other KeyB Mouse combos with upto 1200dpi. It has 10 Mn click life which makes it one and only in the segment.Con - The scroll is sometimes slightly noisy though \ud83d\ude05The Keyboard is ultra soft Chicklet style with adequate weight and it comes with some additional professional functions unlike other keyboards.It has curved silent key operation. Using the keyboard is uniquely comfortable experience.The elegance, quality and trust it offers is only with Asus CW 100.The glitch till now I faced is only with mouse. In the last 10days of my used I experienced 2-3 times of glitch, which is quite occasional in case your system is busy with updates or installing a software.The glitch might be faced maximum 1 out of 100 times in my opinion.The Asus support is also concerned about accessories for claiming warranty.Also you can register the product with S/N on the Asus India website.But Amazon has not provided me with the S/N included invoice and so my warranty registration is rejected. \ud83d\ude33I am still waiting for the S/N included Invoice since 13 days, and still they have asked me more time in such a simple process.Kindly beware before purchasing electronics from Amazon since they do not place S/N on the Invoice.;The product is good. Mouse is silent. And the click feel will be missing, which needs to be a little getting used to. Keyboard is good. But it sounds a bit more for my liking.  Overall good products as expected from such a brand.;Seems sturdy.No lag.Mouse sound is like touchpad button sound. Comfortable to hold.3 buttons b/w space & ctrl. Prob for shortcut.;I had my high hopes on the quality on Asus product. But now I'm totally disappointed as the usb is not being recognised and both the mouse and keyboard is a trash now. It's just been a month now but already it stopped working. Very disappoint with the product. Spent almost 1.3 k.;Very good comboExcellent battery backupKeyboard layout is very simple and classic which I prefer.Mouse clicks are excellent.Both goes into auto sleep mode which is a great plus.Keyboard and mouse both comes with led indicators in spite of having great battery backup.;at rs 999 quality is decent and click on mouse is too soft nad light weight and key press on key board is too soft and very ease for fingers for typing long content.;It's a compact keyboard and keys are robust. One major issue is that caps lock turns on frequently as it is too close to other keys...  So needs frequent switching off and affects continuous typing. Other features and build is good;The keyboard is good. This is my first product from SS which I found very good. The keyboard responds well to the catalog. The light turns on constantly which is a disappointment for battery consumption, that is, it is like this. The battery consumes a lot and the mouse is also not that good, it is decent, that is, the mouse is silent, but the keyboard clicks are slow. I bought it in 899.",

In US its costing around 1.1L to 1.3L,even for the extra cost we aren't getting much things in return the QC issues of Asus is such bothering that people are afraid to get Asus laptops.Compared to tuf a14 this is laughter in terms of specs,only good thing is that it has oled display and some good speakers rest the specification of tuf a14 will make it go in dust.Its advised to sellers as well as Asus and Amazon to price it competitvely.",

I had to upgrade bios due to AMD 4500 processor release few days ago but bios needed change. Got sealed package too. Happy with ASUS quality.  Thanks  Amazon for  quick delivery and perfect packaging;I ordered many mobo but due to old bios I can't run it but in this mobo there is flashback and trust me it's best in this range all other motherboard don't give it which make the first booting experience terrifying.;***Update the bios before assembling*****If you're planning to buy a ryzen 5000 series cpu look no further. The bios flash back functionality is a life saver, it doesn't need a previous gen cpu or any ram, gpu etc to update the bios. The cpu cooler standoffs could have been better, it works fine but it was cumbersome to put the cooler on.;Bought this MB for its cheap price compared to others. It turns out to be really good. Only thing i complain about this is that it doesn't have integrated Wifi. But considering its price, can't really expect integrated wifi adaptor;Working fine \ud83d\udc4d good for price;Bad product never booted up. When i connected the same components to other board it worked good.;I got it with offer of 10% off. The mbd has good features and support docp and overclocking. The pcb quality is slightly on the inferior side. But the major drawback is that I bought this with amd ryzen 5500gt cpu and the heatsink is to big to fit along with the ram. The ram also has heatsink (16gb ripjaw) and is thicker than normal ram without heatsink. So my advice is to buy ram that has no heatsink or avoid this motherboard and look at other models. I still managed to install the ram and cpu by slightly pushing the ram away. It's not ideal but I managed. If you are using a different heatsink then it's ok but the wraith stealth heatsink is not compatible.;Good working this item;Boards came with old BIOS. Did a quick update to latest. Running my ryzen 9 3900x, 7800xt merc 319 & DDR4 3200 and no problems. The looks of this mother board make you think it might be bullet proof.;Fungerade utan problem.RIKTIGT bra moderkort f\u00f6r pengarna.;\u0130stenen \u00fcr\u00fcn sorunsuz geldi;I have this both in my main pc as in my sleeper computer. It definitely waz worth buying this;Having built many computers in my life, Asus has been a common name in my parts. My current computer has an older MATX Asus board, and this recent purchase for a friends computer was a no-brainer.For a simple no-thrills computer, it works perfectly, and at the price-point, there is little to argue about.Having had a range of low range to high-end motherboards in the past, I can wholeheartedly say I am more comfortable with these lower range models. Less features in most cases can be a relief as there are less elements of the board that can go wrong or cause hardware/software issues.If you are not interested in overclocking, or having the highest-market components and don't have too many expansion needs, these boards simply can handle it and last for years on years.The only issue I have is limited case fan headers, however if only using 3 or 4 of the same case fans on Y splitters, no worries.",

It's not even a month since I recived the new laptop, mine stuck at boot screen asus logo, service centre technicians declared it a motherboard issue, it's been with them since a week waiting on parts.I had 2022 g15, it also had screen issues which got replaced under warranty but then webcam stopped and after getting a new webcam machine started getting shutdown 10 min into battery. The service centres are authorised partners of asus and fully incapable of fixing issues reliably.Despite problems with old laptop I went with another of Asus's premium laptop thinking they might have improved. But na, the same old issues due to cheapAss quality checks at asus and their unreliable incapable service partners.;The laptop is metal yet lightweight and sturdy, while packing a punch, The Battery is decent lasted me about 6 hours+ with lightweight browsing and with integrated Graphics. The Ryzen 9 AI HX370 processor has NPU which allows to run AI models locally.Running on RTX4060 with high refresh rates and on high-power mode shortens the battery ( suggesting running it plugged in to save the battery ) the keyboard has only one color ( not a big deal for me ). The biggest drawback is the speaker volume which is very low.Extended warranty is on offer right now at asuspromo website ( document yet for review ) which saves me a good 10K on warranty extension ( highly recommended ). Overall a decent laptop so far, Not sure if i can really save on the extended warranty * yet to see..",

                "text": "Bought the 4070 and Ryzen 9 version.If u r buying for gaming go for it .I been using it for 1 month now .It didn't disappoint.I tested cuple of game's all run very well in max settings.In cyber punk I am getting above 60 fps all settings max and even with path tracing on( with frame gen) if I play with ray tracing max it gets above 80 fps .And in blackmyth wokong i faced minute lag with cinematic preset but runs fine with ultra presetLise of p - about 100 fps in max settingsHorizon forbidden west - 80+ fps in max settingsKingdom come 2 - above 50 avarage with ultra settingsAnd I tried some renders in blender and premier it's really fastI don't recommend for daily carrying it's little heavy and size is also bigBattery backup it not great since it's a gaming laptop;As an avid user of advanced software like Blender and Unreal Engine, I demand a lot from my gaming laptops. The MSI Katana A17 AI not only meets but often exceeds my high expectations in performance. Powered by a Ryzen 7 8845HS and equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, this laptop handles intensive tasks seamlessly without any lag or stutter, a must for graphic design and game development.Battery Life: The battery performance is robust, delivering between 3-4 hours of heavy use and extending up to 5-6 hours for lighter tasks. This is quite impressive for a high-performance gaming laptop, where intensive use usually takes a toll on battery life.Display Quality: The visuals are sharp and smooth on the 44cm FHD display, enhanced by a 144Hz refresh rate which is a boon for gaming and dynamic media consumption. However, the display bezels are on the thicker side, which slightly detracts from an otherwise immersive experience.Speaker Quality: The speakers deliver good audio clarity, enhancing the gaming and multimedia experience. However, they could benefit from a bit more volume to truly match the laptop's overall power and performance.Build and Design: Weighing in at 2.7kg, the laptop is relatively portable for a gaming model. The overall build is sturdy and aesthetically pleasing with a sleek black finish.Room for Improvement: My major gripe is with the size of the display bezels \u2014 a slimmer option would enhance the visual experience. Additionally, the lack of a Type-C charger is a missed opportunity for convenience, especially given the widespread adoption of USB-C for charging and data transfer across devices.Final Thoughts: The MSI Katana A17 AI is a powerful ally for both gamers and professional creators. While it excels in performance, display quality, and audio clarity, a few design tweaks and an update in charging options could make it an unbeatable choice in its category.;Thanks its good product you should buy recommend;This product is a value for money. The physical design is average but the built is very robust. I still have to test out the battery life on the long-run.It's definitely a powerful machine and very suitable for gaming and I have bought this for gaming and CAD tools.. so far it is handling everything I threw at it very smoothly. Would recommend this product.;The media could not be loaded.The only thing you won't regret ever for buying if you love coding, gaming, content creating, etc. Its just simple three words- GO FOR IT!!!  MSI truly understands reasonable pricing for people who want high performance in good value and this is one example. I really suggest you all, go for it.;After a lot of thought, finally got a gaming laptop.And this laptop almost fits what I wanted.This model lacks reviews from reputable sources anywhere online.This was a big and expensive gamble for me.And delivery took 20 days from order date, exactly.So 20 days of warranty loss I guess.Was very disappointed when I saw the delivery dates.Price wise seems to be reasonable I guess, considering a 105W RTX 4060.Never thought 16GB RAM won't be sufficient for modern games.RAM is upgradeable though upto 64GB according to MSI.Wanted to try out and AMD processor after the Athlon 64 days.And I find it zippy considering I am upgrading after 10 years.While playing videos of 720p to 4K, their are many artifacts, hiccups and glitches in hybrid graphics mode.But none of that in discrete graphics mode.Games run smooth and great but the temperatures scares me.CPU and GPU hits 100C while gaming, after which it start slowing everything down and framerates starts dropping.So bought a cooling pad and now max CPU temperatures are 90 and GPU is 90, but the GPU RAM is always 94 and above.The ventilation holes in the bottom panel are very different.None above the fan are provide.Maybe trying to direct airflow through other components before it exits through the cooler.But in winter we can use the exhausts to warm our hands, cuz it gets very hot.2 slots of nvme are their out of which we get 1TB on one slot and the other one vacant, but no mounting hardware is provided.From box to the laptop to the MSI software, everywhere its written for any upgrades consult MSI services center.Sadly their is no MSI service centre in my city.So does that mean I cant perform an upgrade?!For now loving this new laptop after 10 years.Lets see in the long run how it holds up at 90-100 degrees centigrade of thermals.Even on a hill station, at 15\u00b0C of ambient temperature, its running at 90\u00b0-100\u00b0C;This laptop ticks all the boxes to be called as beast. I am using it for last 20 days for my high end software application development. Excellent build qualities. The key boards are very punchy but soft to use. The display is good. Over all its abest purpose I bought it in recent times.",

                "text": "Thanks to amazon for giving massive discount on my sbi card during republic day sale which made it possible for me to get this beast. It performs as you think it would.Everything runs buttery smooth but there is battery drop issue i think 230w adapter will fix that aside from that there is not problem and rgb backlight keyboard would have been cool.;As people have mentioned previously, the main issue is due to unavailablity of iGPU which spoils the battery life. Overall a decent laptop and worth the price.I\u2019ll edit my comms after using it for a couple of months;This laptop is an awesome choice for anyone within this budget. I don't think that you can get a better option within this price range. It's pretty powerful and performs great. The display quality is amazing and with a bit of bios tweaking, i managed to squeeze out even more power from this beast. So if you are in a budget, just go for it.;Got it at 71k, faced a screen flickering issue after 2 days but other than that it worths every single penny in terms of display and gaming. It has better display and gaming performance then nitro and victus.;So the best thing about this laptop is that the build quality is sturdy. Do note that this processor has no iGPU so your battery life is limited to 4 hours and does not go higher than that when not plugged in. That being said a friend of mine got the G14 zyphrus and we were gaming at max settings and this laptop did not hit 60 degrees whereas the G14 was touching 85 degrees hence the cooling system is amazing. Another thing I have realised is that I don\u2019t use the laptop when it isn\u2019t plugged in and I do not require 15 -20 hrs of battery life. Also all tasks and jobs run very smoothly on this and I feel its worth the trade off for price and hardware;This lap when fully charged shuts down in just one hour even with usage without the internet. I bought this gaming laptop expecting it's efficiency. But never expected such a low quality battery in such a new age laptop. What is the use of any technology if you can't use it. Imagine you buy a phone with all the latest technology from the top brand but battery dies  in qn 1 hour, will you buy? Even if it's given for free you won't use it. I wonder why companies even make such useless laptops. Horrible experience from Lenovo, never expected. I feel cheated and and have lost 80,000 I paid for this.;So far i am really satisfied with my Laptop. Yes there are some things that could have been better. Like the brightness could have been better. But the colour accuracy and all is good. The build is noce. Speaker quality is good not so bad but could have been better. It is on a heavier side but you know it is a gaming laptop. Many people complaint about the fan noise but i think most of the gaming laptops have this thing. It is just to keep your machine cool you can ignore that. The fan speed can be kept in quiet mode in normal usage. Battery life if you ask me lasted for 2.5-3hrs but i saw a minor charge drop while i was using heavily. 170w charger is not enough. J suggest you contact the customer care and get a 230w one. I bought it for \u20b969k during republic day sale. I think its worth every penny.;Everything is very good but battery is equally bad",

The 8GB VRAM provided for 4070 is not justified and not sufficient for running ML models. Alan Wake 2 stutters in ultra-wide monitor (3440x1440) even in low setting but keeping the resolution same. The RAM provided is not sufficient and I had to update the RAM in the very first week.  Overpriced esp. due to NVIDIA pricing of graphics cards but all the laptops with 4070 are in this range. Overall a very nice laptop with RAM & VRAM limitations.;Extraordinary Performance for the Price range with RTX 4070, 8GB;It have so many lags and defects , sometimes have to be restarted but performance wise it's good for any purpose.;Bought it laptop solely for Gaming and gameplay recording.Let me tell you one thing, get ghelper and remove asus armory crate. You can find custom profiles for ghelper in Google and configure it accordingly to your preferences.As for gaming tested a few major AAA titles (cyberpunk, Battlefield V, Spider man even the buggy The arkham knight) the performance is pretty good. Frames might drop by 5% when you're recording but it depends which tool you prefer to use.;Week1 review:Good design,Great for gaming, smooth performance with ryzen 9  and 4070 beast card.Temparature not going above 80c thermals better than previous laptops.Satisfied till now .;Performs better than i expected, awesome framerates. Very sturdy built and sleak appearance. Display could have been better.Sufficient air vents ensure proper ventilation of heat. Wont say it was value for money only because of the FHD display, but no other laptops are giving rtx 4070 gpu at this price with ryzen 9 cpu. However it does run like butter even if connected to external screens, tv, monitors etc. Runs most of the AAA game titles at highest graphics settings.;Worth the price tag;Iam a console player owned ps5 and series x both. Looking for a laptop to connect with my 4k tv , so i bought this this laptop can run any game at1440p on ultra settings with dlss on average 70 to 80 fps, tested alan wake 2 , cyberpunk getting 90fps on tv at 1440p. It way better than my expectations. Yes on laptop u can run game with Ultra settings also because screen is 1080p",

                "text": "I recently purchased the Dell 15 Thin & Light Laptop, and so far, I'm quite impressed. It packs a Core i5-1235U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, which makes multitasking smooth and quick. The 15.6\" FHD display is sharp and offers great visuals whether I'm streaming videos or working on documents.What stands out for me is how lightweight it is\u2014just 1.66kg\u2014making it super portable without feeling flimsy. Despite its slim design, the laptop feels sturdy, and the spill-resistant keyboard is a nice touch for added peace of mind.Another bonus is the pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office 2021, so I was ready to work right out of the box. The inclusion of 15 months of McAfee security is a nice plus, especially if you're cautious about online threats.If I had to nitpick, 8GB of RAM is decent for everyday tasks but may not be enough for more intensive work or gaming. Also, the build, while durable, does attract fingerprints, especially on the black finish.Overall, this is an excellent laptop for students, professionals, or anyone needing a reliable machine for daily use without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for its performance, portability, and value!;As soon as the 1year warranty period is over the laptop stopped working. It gets hanged or dropped out when I'm in a meeting. Also it gets hanged when I'm trying to open an excell or any file. I've been trying to reach the customer support as well but they don't take you call or respond to message. Worst customer service and worst product. Please don't buy it.;;Worth buying this, thx.;Fear that...it may blast;nice;I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare. Right out of the box, there was a glaring green dot on the screen that refuses to go away, and the camera is unstable, making it impossible to use for work or meetings.I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to help. When I contacted Dell, their so-called \"support\" team told me they could only replace the LED/ED screen and couldn\u2019t even provide me with a DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter. How does that even make sense for a brand-new product?I trusted Amazon and Dell to deliver a quality product and back it up with proper service, but I\u2019ve been left stuck in the middle with no solution. Both companies are shirking their responsibilities, and now I\u2019m stuck with a defective laptop.This is unacceptable from two major companies that are supposed to be industry leaders. I will think twice before purchasing anything from Amazon or Dell again. Buyers beware! Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.;light weight, good portability, decent looks , good built quality, battery lasts 5-6 hrs for normal use , lasts 8 hrs on battery saver mode if you do light works .  All well except one  issue that is it starts lagging /stuttering, videos get hung if you use the laptop while charging due to overheating . But this problem is solved by using better cooling solution like using laptop bottom riser while charging. Dont forget to buy a laptop riser along with this product.",

Heavy as mentioned. Get it at around 66k after credit card discount. Happiness unboxed.;It lags a lot sometime when your moving your mouse and it heats up a lot when using just a ide or a browser and is over priced. i don't know if it is defective or not coz otherwise it works fine. Despite having a i5 12500 H it somehow works worst. i use this laptop for coding and would recommend everyone who wants to buy this laptop to avoid it or go for lenovo legion 5 or a mac (if your buying for college, school or for any job related activities or even buying a laptop in general).It just isn't worth all the money you put into it.;The media could not be loaded.Review after 4 months. Good laptop but you need to buy a screw driver along with it. Back side screw is automatically loose you need tight every 2 week other wise good laptop. Battery life is around 6hours(grapics card off).performance-in gta 5 max settings around 110 fps.speaker volume is medium but quality is good.;Superb Laptop with great sound quality, Higher performance really value for money, good battery life approx 5 to 6 hour of it's in eco mode . Display was good no shaking and all . Very nice apperance, logo was superb in front of laptop. You should definitely go , i have 16gb 12th gen 3050 rtx . I got it for around 74k approx.;I had purchased the new laptop on 1st Jan 23, and received it on NXT day 2nd Jan 2023 , I reviewed it sealed but on the other side looked like the seal was removed and on the one side the brand manufacturers seal was intact ,,look like i recieved a laptop box returned resale product and not refurbished), after opening the box laptop was looking untouched, charger was also new ,the only thing was missing was  tuf stickers and users book was missing only single paper about how to start windows,the screen has slightly bleed issues which is visible in  the dark not during day other wise the laptop works perfectly smooth,Already registered to asus account but shows warranty rejected after submitting the invice and warranty papersOn asus app it shows 6 months till month of September the warranty isCannot send it back since account already registered my device with manufacturHope if any problems arise i get the device support policy from Amazon sice they can arrange for client manufacturers services for repairs in the warranty described on Amazon description;Great screen size and good customer support.;I bought this alptop last year now all the screw of it came out I don't why? Even after fixing screw comes out. Please stop making such product it will be good for brand else no will buy your product.and if possible exchange my laptop and give me another.I am regretting after buying it.;I have been searching for a laptop for coding,video editing and gaming with big screen as equal to a desktop monitor. This the the best laptop at this price range for gaming and coding as i am an Computer science student i want a laptop that can do all my day to day task, and support heavy software for video editing gaming and many more,i also like to do coding on big screen this is why i buyied this laptop.you can go for this laptop although it is 2022 model but its performance is best",

And the laptop is in top position in upcoming 20years for comparison with any other laptop. No other laptop can beat this in that price range and performance. Better for both the EDUCATION like heavy rendering, programming and GAMING like GTA5 and any other steam games.;What a miracle is this..  absolutely loving it\ud83e\udd29\ud83d\ude18;The media could not be loaded.Amazon and Asus both are worst, Amazon is worst place to buy, today I received my ASUS ROG G-16 4060 i7 13th Gen 1TB SSD for worth \u20b91,34,9900 and my laptop was not even opening I just tried each and everything to turn it on but it won't, even it was not showing any light of charging while plugged it on and not even opening after holding power button for 40,60 seconds. Then Amazon is also not accepting replacement just after 30mins of receiving product and their costumer service is worst the technician talked to me and I told everything about my laptop then they were saying to talk to Asus support team and they are not even responding my call on their customer support number. I even recorded the unboxing video of it and when I open the box and saw that charging cable was already plugged with it's adapter. If they tried this only then I am going to customer court for sure.;The media could not be loaded.Have face no problem with the product and is performing as expected for well over a month with no decline in functionality. Please note the battery life may not be as good as expected especially when you are running demanding applications. Make sure to maintain adequate ventilation to prevent product detoriation. Build quality feels solid and metal like though it is not made of metal. There is no privacy guard for webcam. There is no numbpad on the keyboard. Charging is quite slow even at 280 watts. The charger came with a AEH plug which is not essential but you can switch it for any other cable don't be alarmed.;overall good.upgradable \ud83d\udc4d;I recently upgraded to the ASUS Smartchoice ROG Strix G16, and I couldn\u2019t be more impressed with its performance. From the moment I unboxed it, I could tell this laptop was built for gamers and power users alike. Here\u2019s why:Display:The 16-inch FHD+ display (with a 165Hz refresh rate) is nothing short of stunning. Whether I\u2019m gaming, watching movies, or working on creative projects, the vibrant colors, sharp resolution, and smooth performance make everything look incredible. The 165Hz refresh rate ensures fluid gameplay without any stutter, which is essential for a smooth gaming experience.Performance:With the 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13650HX, this laptop delivers exceptional speed and responsiveness. It handles multitasking, demanding applications, and AAA games effortlessly. I was able to run multiple programs at once with no lag or slowdown. The 16GB RAM ensures smooth performance, and the 1TB SSD provides fast load times and ample space for all my files and games.Graphics:The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 is a game-changer. I\u2019ve played some of the latest titles, and the graphics are breathtaking. High settings and ray tracing are a breeze, and there\u2019s no frame drop or lag. This is definitely a laptop that can keep up with the most demanding graphics-intensive games and tasks.Design & Build:The Eclipse Gray color is sleek and modern, and the overall design is very premium. Despite the powerful hardware, the laptop manages to maintain a solid build without feeling too heavy (weighing in at 2.50 kg). It's robust yet portable enough to carry around when needed.Battery & Software:With Windows 11 pre-installed, the laptop offers a smooth and intuitive user experience. I also appreciate the inclusion of Office 21, which is perfect for productivity. Battery life is decent for such a powerful machine, though I tend to keep it plugged in when gaming for optimal performance.Overall:The ASUS Smartchoice ROG Strix G16 is a powerhouse of a laptop that doesn\u2019t disappoint. Whether you\u2019re a gamer, content creator, or just need a reliable high-performance machine, this laptop delivers on all fronts. The combination of an incredible display, top-tier performance,;The device is really good, but I had to return it, I bought it twice and both times had horrible backlight bleed in the i7 variant of the laptop. Went to the exclusive ROG store and saw that even in those devices there is a backlight bleed. Not to this extent, but still there. If it concerns you, better to avoid it.;The media could not be loaded.New bought Laptop is not switching on whatever you do.  after complaint on Asus & Amazon help center there is no proper response and answer from help center, you can not return this item directly if you got not working laptop that. After 20 days of delivery till return is pending I didn't like this and down trust on asus and Amazon. I think never buy this types product online.",

                "text": "Bought the 4070 and Ryzen 9 version.If u r buying for gaming go for it .I been using it for 1 month now .It didn't disappoint.I tested cuple of game's all run very well in max settings.In cyber punk I am getting above 60 fps all settings max and even with path tracing on( with frame gen) if I play with ray tracing max it gets above 80 fps .And in blackmyth wokong i faced minute lag with cinematic preset but runs fine with ultra presetLise of p - about 100 fps in max settingsHorizon forbidden west - 80+ fps in max settingsKingdom come 2 - above 50 avarage with ultra settingsAnd I tried some renders in blender and premier it's really fastI don't recommend for daily carrying it's little heavy and size is also bigBattery backup it not great since it's a gaming laptop;As an avid user of advanced software like Blender and Unreal Engine, I demand a lot from my gaming laptops. The MSI Katana A17 AI not only meets but often exceeds my high expectations in performance. Powered by a Ryzen 7 8845HS and equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, this laptop handles intensive tasks seamlessly without any lag or stutter, a must for graphic design and game development.Battery Life: The battery performance is robust, delivering between 3-4 hours of heavy use and extending up to 5-6 hours for lighter tasks. This is quite impressive for a high-performance gaming laptop, where intensive use usually takes a toll on battery life.Display Quality: The visuals are sharp and smooth on the 44cm FHD display, enhanced by a 144Hz refresh rate which is a boon for gaming and dynamic media consumption. However, the display bezels are on the thicker side, which slightly detracts from an otherwise immersive experience.Speaker Quality: The speakers deliver good audio clarity, enhancing the gaming and multimedia experience. However, they could benefit from a bit more volume to truly match the laptop's overall power and performance.Build and Design: Weighing in at 2.7kg, the laptop is relatively portable for a gaming model. The overall build is sturdy and aesthetically pleasing with a sleek black finish.Room for Improvement: My major gripe is with the size of the display bezels \u2014 a slimmer option would enhance the visual experience. Additionally, the lack of a Type-C charger is a missed opportunity for convenience, especially given the widespread adoption of USB-C for charging and data transfer across devices.Final Thoughts: The MSI Katana A17 AI is a powerful ally for both gamers and professional creators. While it excels in performance, display quality, and audio clarity, a few design tweaks and an update in charging options could make it an unbeatable choice in its category.;Thanks its good product you should buy recommend;This product is a value for money. The physical design is average but the built is very robust. I still have to test out the battery life on the long-run.It's definitely a powerful machine and very suitable for gaming and I have bought this for gaming and CAD tools.. so far it is handling everything I threw at it very smoothly. Would recommend this product.;The media could not be loaded.The only thing you won't regret ever for buying if you love coding, gaming, content creating, etc. Its just simple three words- GO FOR IT!!!  MSI truly understands reasonable pricing for people who want high performance in good value and this is one example. I really suggest you all, go for it.;After a lot of thought, finally got a gaming laptop.And this laptop almost fits what I wanted.This model lacks reviews from reputable sources anywhere online.This was a big and expensive gamble for me.And delivery took 20 days from order date, exactly.So 20 days of warranty loss I guess.Was very disappointed when I saw the delivery dates.Price wise seems to be reasonable I guess, considering a 105W RTX 4060.Never thought 16GB RAM won't be sufficient for modern games.RAM is upgradeable though upto 64GB according to MSI.Wanted to try out and AMD processor after the Athlon 64 days.And I find it zippy considering I am upgrading after 10 years.While playing videos of 720p to 4K, their are many artifacts, hiccups and glitches in hybrid graphics mode.But none of that in discrete graphics mode.Games run smooth and great but the temperatures scares me.CPU and GPU hits 100C while gaming, after which it start slowing everything down and framerates starts dropping.So bought a cooling pad and now max CPU temperatures are 90 and GPU is 90, but the GPU RAM is always 94 and above.The ventilation holes in the bottom panel are very different.None above the fan are provide.Maybe trying to direct airflow through other components before it exits through the cooler.But in winter we can use the exhausts to warm our hands, cuz it gets very hot.2 slots of nvme are their out of which we get 1TB on one slot and the other one vacant, but no mounting hardware is provided.From box to the laptop to the MSI software, everywhere its written for any upgrades consult MSI services center.Sadly their is no MSI service centre in my city.So does that mean I cant perform an upgrade?!For now loving this new laptop after 10 years.Lets see in the long run how it holds up at 90-100 degrees centigrade of thermals.Even on a hill station, at 15\u00b0C of ambient temperature, its running at 90\u00b0-100\u00b0C;This laptop ticks all the boxes to be called as beast. I am using it for last 20 days for my high end software application development. Excellent build qualities. The key boards are very punchy but soft to use. The display is good. Over all its abest purpose I bought it in recent times.",

                "text": "Edit :  6 month reviewThese are major good and bad things of the laptop. I have played multiple games, even with external monitor. I will list those in the end.Bad things:1. All other reviews have said there is IPS bleeding, sadly even mine has it. And a lot of bleeding.2. Heating - When I play most graphic intensive games, I try to balance the settings to keep thermals low, otherwise it heats too much. I don't think cooling pads on amazon will be of any use its waste.3. Does not have a SD card reader slot.Positives:1. Decent performance in most games either high or medium settings.2. Mousepad and keyboard is good, nice feedback.3. ASUS armory crate software is good, customizable rgb lighting, fan speed etc.Overall it's a soft core gaming laptop.Connected to my monitor - 1. forza horizon ultra settings ~ 75 fps CPU > 85 celsius GPU > 75 celsius2. GTA V mix of medium and high settings stable 60fps CPU < 65, GPU < 603. Resident Evil 4 - mix of med and high settings ~75fps CPU > 85 GPU  > 754. Doom eternal, Apex legends, the finals, spectre divide i haven't tested.If you are Valorant gamer, it should easily give you enough performance and enough quality graphics.As it tends to heat, i think a thermal paste kit and cleaning kit should be bought too for the future.;I purchased the ASUS TUF Gaming F15 on 17th September, expecting a top-tier gaming laptop with its i7 processor and RTX 3050. However, after just TWO DAYS of basic use, the screen went BLACK and the laptop became completely unusable. A brand-new laptop dying after just two days is unacceptable!The specs on paper might look impressive, but what\u2019s the point if the laptop FAILS almost immediately? I didn't even get a chance to test its performance before the screen completely shut down.I trusted ASUS for quality, but this has been a huge disappointment. Now, I\u2019m stuck with a defective product that I have to fix myself by going to a service centre. This kind of poor quality control is shocking for such a reputable brand. Avoid this model unless you want to deal with a massive headache.;Very happy to be a part of ASUS family. Since, I bought Asus F15 Core i7 12th Gen laptop for myself. Amazing graphics, amazing features with inbuilt Nvidia RTX 3050 features and Nvidia Live broadcasting. Lots of new features with ultimate performance. Really loved it.;Very bad display... Only in black screen, too much backlight leakage... So i contacted asus service center... They said its normal... How it could be normal! I use another laptop, never faced that issue... How can in this generation it is normal! Very disappointing...;Worthy for the price but no MS office. You have to buy it separately. Dolby Atmos works good. Battery is good. Gaming - I haven't played yet.;Don't buy this laptop it's very expensive and the model is also old one you can buy same model with better specs at offline store at 78-80k.;Dont buy asus very worst experiance so many software issues getting all errors gaming will not work so heating issues",

This asus exclusivity tax is making the price too much for this laptop which comes without dedicated graphics processor. At best laptops with these processors are worth only around Rs.60000 to Rs.70000.;It is a best product you can buy. The best laptop for students  gaming ke liye bahut achcha haiAur bhut light wait hai",

Got it for ~54,500 rupees in the Great Indian Sale with 4800 card discount and extra 10k off from exchange.The good:1_Absoule value for money at the price I bought it2_Legion's Keyboard..typing experience is stellar \ud83d\udc9a3_Great performance. Scored 13k+ on cinebench r23 multi-core test without using any cooling pad(ambient room temp about 23\u00b0c) I haven't played any games yet except for a VR title without any issues4_display quality is actually pretty good, (although not color accurate).5_ms office classic comes pre-installed6_not too bulky for a gaming laptop.The bad:1_ peak screen brightness is very low. Almost non-usable in ambient daylight at anything under 40% of it's peak brightness.2_Battery backup on this one is one of the worst I've seen in any laptops. So if intend to carry your laptop while travelling, better not forget the charging brick3_ the web cam quality is below average.The ugly:there're two hot air outlets/vents facing hinge of the laptop which releases warm air while gaming and heats up the entire lower part of the display panel\ud83e\udd2fI am worried if this amount of heat will eventually cause harm to the display or not!;;An awesome laptop with having good gaming processors must buy laptop.;1. Laptop screen gets damaged due to the keyboard marks. So you need to create a gap like I did- check the photo attached.2. The keyboard light stopped working. The premium support is scam as they will replace the parts with refurbished parts.3. Battery life is 1 hour to 1.5 hours at max.Don\u2019t waste your money on cheap products. Add some extra money and buy good stuff to save headache and heart break.;First of all, Thanks to Amazon and seller for getting this beauty delivered in 1 day.It's super fast get things done quickly, cpu is fast GPU is amazingUsing it majorily for wfh, but tried yday running far cry 6, my my it ran just smoothlyAfter a mnths of research I feel safe to say, this is an amazing laptop in this price range.If anyone would ask me, i would suggest simply go for this laptop looks are professional and also supports high end games, what else is required ?;Have been using this on and off for a couple of months. The performance and price to value seems to be fair.Running my daily tasks smoothly.Heats up while gaming, so I suggest get a raiser or a cooler to use with it.The battery backup is very disappointing. While watching or doing simple tasks, drains the battery quite quickly.Even keeping it idle for about 15mins would drain 20% battery.  That's on balanced mode.Will update this after a couple of months more.;Pros::This is One of the best laptops you could buy under 80000.: It has 16 gigs of RAM, which makes it really snappy, Every PC game that exists in this world could be played on this laptop.: The display is superb.:You get close to 480 gigs of SSD.: Transfer speed Between discs is really good, close to 1 gb/s. I made a transfer of 30 gigs and it took 33 seconds.Cons:: If you'll part the disk of C drive, close to 220 gigs will be reserved for C drive, which means maximum 260 gigs could be given to other partitions created.: Many people in their reviews mentioned that it was quite heavy, I have had it for quite some time now but I find it of average weight.: The charging port is given in the middle of the left side of laptop, not something I like personally.: There are only 2 USB A ports.Edit : The Heat Vents are on the hinge and really close to the  display so while playing games Like GTA 5, AC Valhalla, Red dead Redemption, it is going to get freaking hot.Tips :1) Install modern flyouts, it gives a really nice finish to sound and brightness menus.2) Install driver easy, there were close to 20 drivers pending for install.3) There are many complaining about the  battery, but I don't find any issue in plunging it in when using, also it gives a backup of around 3.5 hours when unplugged.Pro tip: Uninstall Microsoft Edge.",

And the laptop is in top position in upcoming 20years for comparison with any other laptop. No other laptop can beat this in that price range and performance. Better for both the EDUCATION like heavy rendering, programming and GAMING like GTA5 and any other steam games.;What a miracle is this..  absolutely loving it\ud83e\udd29\ud83d\ude18;The media could not be loaded.Amazon and Asus both are worst, Amazon is worst place to buy, today I received my ASUS ROG G-16 4060 i7 13th Gen 1TB SSD for worth \u20b91,34,9900 and my laptop was not even opening I just tried each and everything to turn it on but it won't, even it was not showing any light of charging while plugged it on and not even opening after holding power button for 40,60 seconds. Then Amazon is also not accepting replacement just after 30mins of receiving product and their costumer service is worst the technician talked to me and I told everything about my laptop then they were saying to talk to Asus support team and they are not even responding my call on their customer support number. I even recorded the unboxing video of it and when I open the box and saw that charging cable was already plugged with it's adapter. If they tried this only then I am going to customer court for sure.;The media could not be loaded.Have face no problem with the product and is performing as expected for well over a month with no decline in functionality. Please note the battery life may not be as good as expected especially when you are running demanding applications. Make sure to maintain adequate ventilation to prevent product detoriation. Build quality feels solid and metal like though it is not made of metal. There is no privacy guard for webcam. There is no numbpad on the keyboard. Charging is quite slow even at 280 watts. The charger came with a AEH plug which is not essential but you can switch it for any other cable don't be alarmed.;overall good.upgradable \ud83d\udc4d;I recently upgraded to the ASUS Smartchoice ROG Strix G16, and I couldn\u2019t be more impressed with its performance. From the moment I unboxed it, I could tell this laptop was built for gamers and power users alike. Here\u2019s why:Display:The 16-inch FHD+ display (with a 165Hz refresh rate) is nothing short of stunning. Whether I\u2019m gaming, watching movies, or working on creative projects, the vibrant colors, sharp resolution, and smooth performance make everything look incredible. The 165Hz refresh rate ensures fluid gameplay without any stutter, which is essential for a smooth gaming experience.Performance:With the 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13650HX, this laptop delivers exceptional speed and responsiveness. It handles multitasking, demanding applications, and AAA games effortlessly. I was able to run multiple programs at once with no lag or slowdown. The 16GB RAM ensures smooth performance, and the 1TB SSD provides fast load times and ample space for all my files and games.Graphics:The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 is a game-changer. I\u2019ve played some of the latest titles, and the graphics are breathtaking. High settings and ray tracing are a breeze, and there\u2019s no frame drop or lag. This is definitely a laptop that can keep up with the most demanding graphics-intensive games and tasks.Design & Build:The Eclipse Gray color is sleek and modern, and the overall design is very premium. Despite the powerful hardware, the laptop manages to maintain a solid build without feeling too heavy (weighing in at 2.50 kg). It's robust yet portable enough to carry around when needed.Battery & Software:With Windows 11 pre-installed, the laptop offers a smooth and intuitive user experience. I also appreciate the inclusion of Office 21, which is perfect for productivity. Battery life is decent for such a powerful machine, though I tend to keep it plugged in when gaming for optimal performance.Overall:The ASUS Smartchoice ROG Strix G16 is a powerhouse of a laptop that doesn\u2019t disappoint. Whether you\u2019re a gamer, content creator, or just need a reliable high-performance machine, this laptop delivers on all fronts. The combination of an incredible display, top-tier performance,;The device is really good, but I had to return it, I bought it twice and both times had horrible backlight bleed in the i7 variant of the laptop. Went to the exclusive ROG store and saw that even in those devices there is a backlight bleed. Not to this extent, but still there. If it concerns you, better to avoid it.;The media could not be loaded.New bought Laptop is not switching on whatever you do.  after complaint on Asus & Amazon help center there is no proper response and answer from help center, you can not return this item directly if you got not working laptop that. After 20 days of delivery till return is pending I didn't like this and down trust on asus and Amazon. I think never buy this types product online.",

                "text": "Edit :  6 month reviewThese are major good and bad things of the laptop. I have played multiple games, even with external monitor. I will list those in the end.Bad things:1. All other reviews have said there is IPS bleeding, sadly even mine has it. And a lot of bleeding.2. Heating - When I play most graphic intensive games, I try to balance the settings to keep thermals low, otherwise it heats too much. I don't think cooling pads on amazon will be of any use its waste.3. Does not have a SD card reader slot.Positives:1. Decent performance in most games either high or medium settings.2. Mousepad and keyboard is good, nice feedback.3. ASUS armory crate software is good, customizable rgb lighting, fan speed etc.Overall it's a soft core gaming laptop.Connected to my monitor - 1. forza horizon ultra settings ~ 75 fps CPU > 85 celsius GPU > 75 celsius2. GTA V mix of medium and high settings stable 60fps CPU < 65, GPU < 603. Resident Evil 4 - mix of med and high settings ~75fps CPU > 85 GPU  > 754. Doom eternal, Apex legends, the finals, spectre divide i haven't tested.If you are Valorant gamer, it should easily give you enough performance and enough quality graphics.As it tends to heat, i think a thermal paste kit and cleaning kit should be bought too for the future.;I purchased the ASUS TUF Gaming F15 on 17th September, expecting a top-tier gaming laptop with its i7 processor and RTX 3050. However, after just TWO DAYS of basic use, the screen went BLACK and the laptop became completely unusable. A brand-new laptop dying after just two days is unacceptable!The specs on paper might look impressive, but what\u2019s the point if the laptop FAILS almost immediately? I didn't even get a chance to test its performance before the screen completely shut down.I trusted ASUS for quality, but this has been a huge disappointment. Now, I\u2019m stuck with a defective product that I have to fix myself by going to a service centre. This kind of poor quality control is shocking for such a reputable brand. Avoid this model unless you want to deal with a massive headache.;Very happy to be a part of ASUS family. Since, I bought Asus F15 Core i7 12th Gen laptop for myself. Amazing graphics, amazing features with inbuilt Nvidia RTX 3050 features and Nvidia Live broadcasting. Lots of new features with ultimate performance. Really loved it.;Very bad display... Only in black screen, too much backlight leakage... So i contacted asus service center... They said its normal... How it could be normal! I use another laptop, never faced that issue... How can in this generation it is normal! Very disappointing...;Worthy for the price but no MS office. You have to buy it separately. Dolby Atmos works good. Battery is good. Gaming - I haven't played yet.;Don't buy this laptop it's very expensive and the model is also old one you can buy same model with better specs at offline store at 78-80k.;Dont buy asus very worst experiance so many software issues getting all errors gaming will not work so heating issues",

Slightly bulky feels good sleek design;Best phone;This phone is for you if you are looking for a sturdy, smart and practical phone with a neat user experience. The phone surely feels premium in hand and looks distinct from other devices.UI is amazing. No bloatware, clean design and lot of emphasis on practicality and user friendliness.Another department where phone scores very high is it's battery. It easily last for 2 days if you are an average user.The only area where phone underperforms is the camera. Despite good specs , the image quality is snot consistent. Colours are often saturated (even after the latest update) and the edge detection in potrait mode is still a struggle. Hopefully Nothing team will roll out more updates to improve and stablize the camera of the phone.Overall, a great product at this price point.;V good product;Not a good phones;Looks greatValue for moneyPerformance greatAll things great except camera nothing shouldwork on camera.;Worth money.Best product at this price;While it does lag sometimes, is still gives 90 FPS in BGMI.

                "text": "Bought the 4070 and Ryzen 9 version.If u r buying for gaming go for it .I been using it for 1 month now .It didn't disappoint.I tested cuple of game's all run very well in max settings.In cyber punk I am getting above 60 fps all settings max and even with path tracing on( with frame gen) if I play with ray tracing max it gets above 80 fps .And in blackmyth wokong i faced minute lag with cinematic preset but runs fine with ultra presetLise of p - about 100 fps in max settingsHorizon forbidden west - 80+ fps in max settingsKingdom come 2 - above 50 avarage with ultra settingsAnd I tried some renders in blender and premier it's really fastI don't recommend for daily carrying it's little heavy and size is also bigBattery backup it not great since it's a gaming laptop;As an avid user of advanced software like Blender and Unreal Engine, I demand a lot from my gaming laptops. The MSI Katana A17 AI not only meets but often exceeds my high expectations in performance. Powered by a Ryzen 7 8845HS and equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, this laptop handles intensive tasks seamlessly without any lag or stutter, a must for graphic design and game development.Battery Life: The battery performance is robust, delivering between 3-4 hours of heavy use and extending up to 5-6 hours for lighter tasks. This is quite impressive for a high-performance gaming laptop, where intensive use usually takes a toll on battery life.Display Quality: The visuals are sharp and smooth on the 44cm FHD display, enhanced by a 144Hz refresh rate which is a boon for gaming and dynamic media consumption. However, the display bezels are on the thicker side, which slightly detracts from an otherwise immersive experience.Speaker Quality: The speakers deliver good audio clarity, enhancing the gaming and multimedia experience. However, they could benefit from a bit more volume to truly match the laptop's overall power and performance.Build and Design: Weighing in at 2.7kg, the laptop is relatively portable for a gaming model. The overall build is sturdy and aesthetically pleasing with a sleek black finish.Room for Improvement: My major gripe is with the size of the display bezels \u2014 a slimmer option would enhance the visual experience. Additionally, the lack of a Type-C charger is a missed opportunity for convenience, especially given the widespread adoption of USB-C for charging and data transfer across devices.Final Thoughts: The MSI Katana A17 AI is a powerful ally for both gamers and professional creators. While it excels in performance, display quality, and audio clarity, a few design tweaks and an update in charging options could make it an unbeatable choice in its category.;Thanks its good product you should buy recommend;This product is a value for money. The physical design is average but the built is very robust. I still have to test out the battery life on the long-run.It's definitely a powerful machine and very suitable for gaming and I have bought this for gaming and CAD tools.. so far it is handling everything I threw at it very smoothly. Would recommend this product.;The media could not be loaded.The only thing you won't regret ever for buying if you love coding, gaming, content creating, etc. Its just simple three words- GO FOR IT!!!  MSI truly understands reasonable pricing for people who want high performance in good value and this is one example. I really suggest you all, go for it.;After a lot of thought, finally got a gaming laptop.And this laptop almost fits what I wanted.This model lacks reviews from reputable sources anywhere online.This was a big and expensive gamble for me.And delivery took 20 days from order date, exactly.So 20 days of warranty loss I guess.Was very disappointed when I saw the delivery dates.Price wise seems to be reasonable I guess, considering a 105W RTX 4060.Never thought 16GB RAM won't be sufficient for modern games.RAM is upgradeable though upto 64GB according to MSI.Wanted to try out and AMD processor after the Athlon 64 days.And I find it zippy considering I am upgrading after 10 years.While playing videos of 720p to 4K, their are many artifacts, hiccups and glitches in hybrid graphics mode.But none of that in discrete graphics mode.Games run smooth and great but the temperatures scares me.CPU and GPU hits 100C while gaming, after which it start slowing everything down and framerates starts dropping.So bought a cooling pad and now max CPU temperatures are 90 and GPU is 90, but the GPU RAM is always 94 and above.The ventilation holes in the bottom panel are very different.None above the fan are provide.Maybe trying to direct airflow through other components before it exits through the cooler.But in winter we can use the exhausts to warm our hands, cuz it gets very hot.2 slots of nvme are their out of which we get 1TB on one slot and the other one vacant, but no mounting hardware is provided.From box to the laptop to the MSI software, everywhere its written for any upgrades consult MSI services center.Sadly their is no MSI service centre in my city.So does that mean I cant perform an upgrade?!For now loving this new laptop after 10 years.Lets see in the long run how it holds up at 90-100 degrees centigrade of thermals.Even on a hill station, at 15\u00b0C of ambient temperature, its running at 90\u00b0-100\u00b0C;This laptop ticks all the boxes to be called as beast. I am using it for last 20 days for my high end software application development. Excellent build qualities. The key boards are very punchy but soft to use. The display is good. Over all its abest purpose I bought it in recent times.",

Very effective device giving me whole bandwidth provided by ISP and no more dead spot in my home of 2800 Sq ft.In pricing, it is lil bit costly for wifi 6 mesh but  felt worth when comparing other wifi 6 mesh performances.Must recommended.;All my router troubles are history :) No more connectivity, downtime, range issues..2500ft house with concrete walls. Get good speed everywhere and 300Mbs in the living room with 20 devices connected.;Users of this product could face issues with reliability, stability and performance of connection. It may or may not be alleviated with firmware updates. This is not a product that users may use with peace of mind. It requires careful tinkering with options and even then the reliability is sketchy at best.Coverage and Wi-Fi range are not going to make you happy if you bought this product specifically to eliminate coverage issues.All in all, I returned this product and bought another mesh Wi-Fi product instead that has served me well for 3 years and counting. I didn\u2019t have to tinker with it, that one is truly set and forget. Which one was it? It was Orbi Pro.But, keep in mind that I needed Orbi Pro because I was pushing the limits of Wi-Fi in terms of coverage and ASUS XT8 seemed like it should have worked but failed.;Surprised that I received a used product marked as \"NEW\". Returned the product.;It covers my whole 2bhk apt....was very easy to install.....I now get upload and download speed of 200+mbps which is the promised speed by my isp;Received the order within 12 hrs and works right away. Setup takes just a few minutes. Excellent service and performance.;Really good range. Covers my 2 bedroom apartment completely.;best mesh router with better coverage and speed. am using it in mesh setup with RT AX 5400. Its doing pretty good.",

So the quality and reliability here should not be questioned anyday.The mouse is silent with compact design with adjustable dpi (upto 1600). By default it is set to 1000dpi. The clicks are little bit stiff. It has optical sensor unlike cheap 1000rs set of keyB n Mouse.This mouse is way better than Other KeyB Mouse combos with upto 1200dpi. It has 10 Mn click life which makes it one and only in the segment.Con - The scroll is sometimes slightly noisy though \ud83d\ude05The Keyboard is ultra soft Chicklet style with adequate weight and it comes with some additional professional functions unlike other keyboards.It has curved silent key operation. Using the keyboard is uniquely comfortable experience.The elegance, quality and trust it offers is only with Asus CW 100.The glitch till now I faced is only with mouse. In the last 10days of my used I experienced 2-3 times of glitch, which is quite occasional in case your system is busy with updates or installing a software.The glitch might be faced maximum 1 out of 100 times in my opinion.The Asus support is also concerned about accessories for claiming warranty.Also you can register the product with S/N on the Asus India website.But Amazon has not provided me with the S/N included invoice and so my warranty registration is rejected. \ud83d\ude33I am still waiting for the S/N included Invoice since 13 days, and still they have asked me more time in such a simple process.Kindly beware before purchasing electronics from Amazon since they do not place S/N on the Invoice.;The product is good. Mouse is silent. And the click feel will be missing, which needs to be a little getting used to. Keyboard is good. But it sounds a bit more for my liking.  Overall good products as expected from such a brand.;Seems sturdy.No lag.Mouse sound is like touchpad button sound. Comfortable to hold.3 buttons b/w space & ctrl. Prob for shortcut.;I had my high hopes on the quality on Asus product. But now I'm totally disappointed as the usb is not being recognised and both the mouse and keyboard is a trash now. It's just been a month now but already it stopped working. Very disappoint with the product. Spent almost 1.3 k.;Very good comboExcellent battery backupKeyboard layout is very simple and classic which I prefer.Mouse clicks are excellent.Both goes into auto sleep mode which is a great plus.Keyboard and mouse both comes with led indicators in spite of having great battery backup.;at rs 999 quality is decent and click on mouse is too soft nad light weight and key press on key board is too soft and very ease for fingers for typing long content.;It's a compact keyboard and keys are robust. One major issue is that caps lock turns on frequently as it is too close to other keys...  So needs frequent switching off and affects continuous typing. Other features and build is good;The keyboard is good. This is my first product from SS which I found very good. The keyboard responds well to the catalog. The light turns on constantly which is a disappointment for battery consumption, that is, it is like this. The battery consumes a lot and the mouse is also not that good, it is decent, that is, the mouse is silent, but the keyboard clicks are slow. I bought it in 899.",

                "text": "I have been using this Silent Mouse, and it has quickly become my go-to for both work and casual gaming.Pros:\u2022 Quiet Clicks: The silent click feature is a game-changer, allowing me to work in shared spaces without disturbing others.\u2022 Comfortable Design: The ergonomic shape fits comfortably in my hand, reducing fatigue during long sessions.\u2022 Responsive Tracking: The sensor is accurate and performs well on various surfaces, making it suitable for both everyday tasks and gaming.\u2022 Battery Life: The battery lasts a long time, and it uses a convenient USB receiver, eliminating the need for frequent recharging.Cons:\u2022 Limited Customization: While it works great out of the box, advanced users might find the lack of programmable buttons a drawback.\u2022 Size: It may be a bit small for users with larger hands, hence NOT IDEAL for SERIOUS GAMERSOverall, the Asus Silent Mouse is an excellent choice for anyone seeking a quiet, comfortable, and reliable mouse. It combines functionality with a thoughtful design, making it perfect for both office work and casual gaming. Highly recommended!;The ASUS Marshmallow Mouse MD100 Steven Harrington Edition is not just an ordinary wireless mouse; it is a combination of style, performance, and quiet operation. This limited edition mouse, designed in collaboration with artist Steven Harrington, stands out as a unique and fun addition to any tech setup while maintaining solid functionality for everyday use.Design & Aesthetic:What immediately grabs attention is the vibrant, art-inspired design. Steven Harrington\u2019s playful and surreal style is imprinted on the mouse, adding a touch of personality to an otherwise mundane tech accessory. The compact, lightweight build (weighing just 56g) makes it ideal for portability, fitting comfortably into backpacks or laptop bags without adding bulk. The feel in the hand is comfortable, especially for those who prefer smaller mice, and it\u2019s an eye-catching accessory whether you\u2019re at the office or working remotely.Silent Clicks:One of the standout features of the MD100 is its silent operation. The buttons produce virtually no clicking noise, making it a great choice for quiet environments such as libraries, meetings, or late-night work sessions. This \u201csilent click\u201d design delivers the same responsiveness without the distracting noise of a traditional mouse, which can be a game-changer for professionals who share workspaces.Adjustable DPI and Performance:Functionality is where this mouse continues to shine. With adjustable DPI (Dots Per Inch) settings, ranging from 800 to 1600 DPI, users can easily switch between precision tasks (like photo editing) and general browsing or office work. The sensitivity adjustment is a useful feature, allowing for customized control depending on your task or personal preference.The optical sensor is highly responsive across different surfaces, including mouse pads and standard desks. While it\u2019s not a gaming mouse, the performance is more than adequate for general productivity and creative tasks.Multi-Mode Connectivity:The MD100 is versatile when it comes to connectivity. It supports both 2.4GHz wireless (via USB receiver) and Bluetooth, making it compatible with a wide range of devices from desktops and laptops to tablets. Switching between devices is seamless, and the setup process is straightforward. The multi-mode functionality makes it a solid option for users who juggle multiple devices regularly. However, it should be noted that there\u2019s no USB-C dongle included for newer laptops, which is a minor downside.Battery Life:ASUS claims an impressive battery life of up to one year on a single AA battery, depending on usage. For most users, this means the mouse will run for months without needing a replacement. The battery compartment is easy to access, and the mouse features an automatic sleep mode to conserve power when not in use.Ergonomics:Due to its small size, the ASUS Marshmallow MD100 is better suited for users with smaller hands or those who prefer claw or fingertip grip styles. For larger hands or those who require a more ergonomically shaped mouse for long sessions, this might not be the most comfortable option. However, the weight and portability make it a go-to mouse for travel or on-the-go use.Drawbacks:While the Steven Harrington design is a definite plus for those who appreciate artistic collaborations, it might not appeal to those looking for a more minimalist, professional look. Additionally, the lack of an included USB-C adapter could be inconvenient for users with newer devices.Conclusion:The ASUS Marshmallow Mouse MD100 Steven Harrington Edition is more than just a visually appealing gadget. It blends essential features like silent operation, multi-device connectivity, and adjustable DPI into a portable, stylish package. For those seeking a compact, quiet mouse with an artistic flair, this limited edition is a fantastic choice. However, users with larger hands or specific ergonomic needs may want to consider other options.Rating: 4.5/5;Light weight. Good looking. Good tactile clicks. Good size. Fits into my hand very easily. Good texture. Good scroll wheel. Good connectivity options: wifi, bt, usb. Only issue is my mouse turns off all of a sudden and I need to remove the battery and install it again for it to turn back again. Other than this minor inconvenience, good product.;This is an awesome mouse. Great price and great value for money plus good quality. The mouse is sleek, allows me to shift between my laptop and iPad using either radio frequency with an USB dongle or Bluetooth. Connecting and transferring between the two is just a simple flip of a small switch underneath. Very well designed and made.;Must buy, it's beat wireless mouse I have used under this budget, it's very silent, great texture and size.",

I've used both apps at the same time without any lag. But the RAM usage hits about 80%. Upgrading to 32GB is a better choice if you want more room for multitasking. Officially, a 32GB upgrade(16x2) is supported, but since I'm planning to tackle more intensive tasks, I'm thinking of upgrading to 64GB (34x2) soon. I'll update the review if it works!;The ASUS TUF F15: A Gaming Laptop Review:I recently purchased the ASUS TUF F15, and I must say, it has far exceeded my expectations. This laptop is a powerhouse, offering a seamless blend of performance, durability, and visual brilliance.Performance: The ASUS TUF F15 is equipped with an Intel Core i7 CPU, ensuring blazing fast speeds and smooth multitasking. Whether Iis gaming, editing videos, or running intensive applications, the processor handles it all with ease.Graphics: The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 GPU is a game-changer. Gaming on the TUF F15 is a visual delight, with stunning graphics and fluid frame rates. The RTX 4050 brings games to life, delivering exceptional detail and realism that immerses you completely.Battery Life: One of the standout features of the ASUS TUF F15 is its impressive battery life. Despite its powerful components, the laptop manages to deliver hours of uninterrupted use but without any gameplay. I am working remotely and so a lot of graphic work, I can count on the TUF F15 to keep up with my demands without constantly searching for a power outlet.Display: The 15.6-inch Full HD display is another highlight. With a 144Hz refresh rate, every movement and action on the screen is incredibly smooth. The colors are vibrant, and the sharpness is on point, making gaming, streaming, and even casual browsing a visual treat. As a graphic designer, I greatly appreciate the 100% sRGB color gamut, which ensures accurate and consistent colors across all my projects. This level of color fidelity is crucial for creating and editing designs with precision.In summary, the ASUS TUF F15 is a remarkable gaming laptop that combines top-tier performance, stunning graphics, long-lasting battery life, and a superb display. It is built to handle the demands of gamers, power users, and creative professionals alike, making it a versatile and reliable choice.

The MSI Katana A17 AI not only meets but often exceeds my high expectations in performance. Powered by a Ryzen 7 8845HS and equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, this laptop handles intensive tasks seamlessly without any lag or stutter, a must for graphic design and game development.Battery Life: The battery performance is robust, delivering between 3-4 hours of heavy use and extending up to 5-6 hours for lighter tasks. This is quite impressive for a high-performance gaming laptop, where intensive use usually takes a toll on battery life.Display Quality: The visuals are sharp and smooth on the 44cm FHD display, enhanced by a 144Hz refresh rate which is a boon for gaming and dynamic media consumption. However, the display bezels are on the thicker side, which slightly detracts from an otherwise immersive experience.Speaker Quality: The speakers deliver good audio clarity, enhancing the gaming and multimedia experience. However, they could benefit from a bit more volume to truly match the laptop's overall power and performance.Build and Design: Weighing in at 2.7kg, the laptop is relatively portable for a gaming model. The overall build is sturdy and aesthetically pleasing with a sleek black finish.Room for Improvement: My major gripe is with the size of the display bezels \u2014 a slimmer option would enhance the visual experience. Additionally, the lack of a Type-C charger is a missed opportunity for convenience, especially given the widespread adoption of USB-C for charging and data transfer across devices.Final Thoughts: The MSI Katana A17 AI is a powerful ally for both gamers and professional creators. While it excels in performance, display quality, and audio clarity, a few design tweaks and an update in charging options could make it an unbeatable choice in its category.;Thanks its good product you should buy recommend;This product is a value for money. The physical design is average but the built is very robust. I still have to test out the battery life on the long-run.It's definitely a powerful machine and very suitable for gaming and I have bought this for gaming and CAD tools.. so far it is handling everything I threw at it very smoothly. Would recommend this product.;The media could not be loaded.The only thing you won't regret ever for buying if you love coding, gaming, content creating, etc. Its just simple three words- GO FOR IT!!!  MSI truly understands reasonable pricing for people who want high performance in good value and this is one example. I really suggest you all, go for it.;After a lot of thought, finally got a gaming laptop.And this laptop almost fits what I wanted.This model lacks reviews from reputable sources anywhere online.This was a big and expensive gamble for me.And delivery took 20 days from order date, exactly.So 20 days of warranty loss I guess.Was very disappointed when I saw the delivery dates.Price wise seems to be reasonable I guess, considering a 105W RTX 4060.Never thought 16GB RAM won't be sufficient for modern games.RAM is upgradeable though upto 64GB according to MSI.Wanted to try out and AMD processor after the Athlon 64 days.And I find it zippy considering I am upgrading after 10 years.While playing videos of 720p to 4K, their are many artifacts, hiccups and glitches in hybrid graphics mode.But none of that in discrete graphics mode.Games run smooth and great but the temperatures scares me.CPU and GPU hits 100C while gaming, after which it start slowing everything down and framerates starts dropping.So bought a cooling pad and now max CPU temperatures are 90 and GPU is 90, but the GPU RAM is always 94 and above.The ventilation holes in the bottom panel are very different.None above the fan are provide.Maybe trying to direct airflow through other components before it exits through the cooler.But in winter we can use the exhausts to warm our hands, cuz it gets very hot.2 slots of nvme are their out of which we get 1TB on one slot and the other one vacant, but no mounting hardware is provided.From box to the laptop to the MSI software, everywhere its written for any upgrades consult MSI services center.Sadly their is no MSI service centre in my city.So does that mean I cant perform an upgrade?!For now loving this new laptop after 10 years.Lets see in the long run how it holds up at 90-100 degrees centigrade of thermals.Even on a hill station, at 15\u00b0C of ambient temperature, its running at 90\u00b0-100\u00b0C;This laptop ticks all the boxes to be called as beast. I am using it for last 20 days for my high end software application development. Excellent build qualities. The key boards are very punchy but soft to use. The display is good. Over all its abest purpose I bought it in recent times.",

            {
                "text": "The ASUS Marshmallow KW100 Keyboard is an excellent choice for those seeking a quiet, compact, and versatile wireless keyboard. Its comfortable typing experience, long battery life, and multi-device connectivity make it a great option for everyday use at home, in the office, or on the go. While it may not be suitable for users who prefer larger keyboards, it's a great choice for most users seeking a reliable and affordable wireless keyboard.;The size is compact and does not occupy much space on your workspace which is very convenient.Typing is a breeze on this keyboard and it allows fast typing owing to the less key travel and the its scissor switches. Almost feels like typing on a MacBook keyboard. Also the colours are soothing and aesthetically pleasing.However the price is a bit high. At this price range you can buy good quality mechanical keyboards but I guess the use cases are different. This keyboard is very good for speed typing but feels bit delicate for hardcore gaming. Mechanical keyboards are more durable and suitable for rugged gaming but do not offer such a good typing experience. So one must decide accordingly.I say you should go for it if you don't use it for gaming \ud83d\udc4d;The media could not be loaded.It's the best ever! So compact, so lightweight. Initially, I was a bit reluctant about how it was going to be, since things that appear this beautiful are not always the most practical. I feel so happy as I write this review using the Asus keyboard that I just received. The usage is seamless, and ah I love the feel of it! 100% recommend and worth the money. Especially for someone, who's into more minimal and non-corporate looking devices, this one's for you. I was using a keyboard by IGear before this, typewriter inspired, it was quite beautiful, but supremely bulky and had USB cable system which is honestly not very compatible with new Mac series with C-type plug in. This one barely took a minute to connect via bluetooth! Have a satisfactory motivation to study all day and utilise this keyboard \u2618\ufe0e;I bought the Green Tea Latte. It comes with a thick bunch of paperwork and 2AAA batteries. There's an on-off switch at the back. The letters are crisp and clear. The key travel is decent. It's silent. It gets into some battery-saving mode if not used for 5 to 10 mins (didn't measure). Hence, you can't start typing as it requires one stroke and a second to wake up. So, get in the habit of hitting the space bar if you don't want your documents to have typos.At this price (Rs 2899), it should have been backlit and should have come with lithium-ion batteries. If that would have made the price to Rs 3000, then it would have made more sense. Nevertheless, this is a good one.Update: The keyboard goes to sleep too fast.....and requires a keystroke to wake up, leading to typos!;The keyboard looks very good that\u2019s the only fair point they have. Pairing doesn\u2019t work. The first time I don\u2019t know how it paired with laptop but it did. F key stopped working the next week. I tried contacting Asus service centre they said \u201cthey don\u2019t deal with keyboards\u201d now am trying to pair it with my pc, been holding fn and 1 key from 10 mins it is not blinking I tried with fn+2 and fn+3 as well it didn\u2019t work. If it doesn\u2019t work in the next 15 mins might break it.;The media could not be loaded.Quality - excellent at this pricePairing and ease of use - excellentImprovements- replace batteries with rechargeable type c port, dark ink on gray keys, and should asseble body with screw so that in future easy to clean or do small repairs yourself if any.;I really like the design and the typing experience of this keyboard.But one thing that has been annoying me for past 6 months since i bought it is its wake time.So - You click on it to wake it up, it takes atleast 2 seconds to do it. And then only it will detect the future input, not the one you clicked to wake it. But that was not the case with Logitech 380 (but logi keyboard has bad key placement that you cant type in those round keys)Sometimes if you keep clicking on it to wake, it wont detect any of the keys at all, because it seems like the wake timer (2 sec approx) keep resetting after every key stroke. So if you press 7-8 keys simultaneously to start working on it, it wont detect any. You have to wait till it actually wakes up, and then you can start typing.I was quite okay with such delay, but sometimes it annoys that it cant be fixed.Few good things about it -1. No software needed. (unlike logitech keyboard, who need a software + they will track every key stroke of yours. Dont know if they even send that data to their cloud.)2. Key spacing and key travel very good.3. Quite silent if typing comfortably.4. Battery lasts long. 6 months and still running.5. Good design. Asus also sells similar color mouse to complete your set.6. Works well on macbook and ipad.7. Has inbuilt keys to switch between windows and mac key bindings.Cons1. Cant customize shortcuts on the keyboard with any utility as there is none, but personally i dont care.2. Delay in wake up time explained in the start of the review.;Has the kind of comfortable keys i was looking for, doesn\u2019t take up too much space, can connect to any device: phone, tablet or desktop, anddd it\u2019s so aesthetic.Would recommend for the girlies to grab this while it\u2019s on discount \u2728\u2728",

                "text": "The media could not be loaded.At this price, this is really a good deal for the performance this laptop has to offer.Boot time is around 30-35 seconds. Don't know why, but seems bit higher to me. Also the last BIOS time is around 10-12 seconds.BIOS settings has GUI (of course :D) for customizations like selecting the number of P & E cores to enable/disable. Unable to recall others atm.The CPU performance is as one would expect from 12700H. You're never out of performance with 14 cores (20, considering hyperthreading on P-cores). But get ready for higher level of fan noise for intensive tasks. Not that annoying but still. A laptop stand is recommended.What I like is Armoury crate has various options to tweak according to the needs for both CPU as well as GPU.Also, with My ASUS app there's an option for battery care which limits charging to 80% (cannot change this), which I personally like.Fans can indeed get little louder in performance mode itself. Happens when I play some games. With turbo mode, they're just as louder as they can get. The temperature reaches around 70-85 degrees even in older titles. For some reason, Armoury crate's power plan is being overridden by Windows when I play games.The display is okayish, not too good, but not that bad either. Good thing is 144Hz and G-Sync support. Take a note that max brightness is only 250 nits. So if you're planning to use it outdoors under a sunny day, it just might not be enough.Touchpad is great, scrolling is smooth, no lag whatsoever. Gets visible smudges though.WD's SN740 nvme is exceptional with 5000 MB/s and 4000 MB/s sequential read and write speeds respectively.Camera is quite awful. But, just enough for meetings and casual video calls I guess. Would recommend external ones though.Microphone is worst. External ones are highly recommended.Keyboard is decent enough. Number keys are bit squeezed. Feels little smaller than the ones I am used to in laptops. Customizable RGB lights (along with brightness, 0% to turn them off) with Armoury crate. Remember that only one color will be used for whole keyboard. Its not multi-zone. WASD keys are  transparent.Speakers are decently loud. I use external ones so, can't say much about them, but from what I have heard until now, I would say it's not that bad, but would definitely prefer them little louder if I were to only use laptop's speakers. Its not a deal breaker though.For expansion, it supports upto 32 GB DDR4 RAM and 2TB SSD.It comes with bigger size plug (like the ones found in refrigerator, geysers, etc.), so a converter would be required to plug it into normal sockets. Makes sense, since the charger has to handle upto 240W of power. Input: 100-240V, 3.5A AC and Output: 20V, 10-12A DC.Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with this purchase. It's been well over 15 days since I am using this laptop. Register the laptop on Asus' website once you receive it for warranty claims and other stuff.;If you haven't already been impressed by the mind-blowing specifications that the Asus Tuf Gaming F15 2023 model brings with it, i e, i7-12700H, RTX 4060 with a 140W TDP, 100% sRGB 144Hz screen and pretty decent cooling system, you will definitely be shocked to see it actually perform.Cinebench r32 scores: multi-core-18432(it depends on other factors but let's go with this)Single core- 1738Reaches 95\u00b0C-96\u00b0C under max load in an ambient room temperature of 28\u00b0C to 32\u00b0C. But thanks to the cooling system, you can see the temperatures drop to normal temps which are around 40\u00b0C to 48\u00b0C. Keyoards feel amazing and touch and feel of the trackpad is also nice, i quite enjoyed it, but i use a wireless keyboard and a Redragon m810, so that's the best i can tell you base upon the three days i used the laaptop without any other accessories. Webcam is, good enough. I honestly have no use for it so i just stuck a privacy shutter on it. Ok, the lights, keyboard lights up, single zone rgb lighting and has Aura Sync, very useful for Diwali and other celebrations imo, and, customisable too. Gpu performs very well, good fps consistently and i actually do have to try it out more. Did a Blende Benchmark and got about 3178.14 or so score, which is, honestly good enough for anything a student of 3D animation like me could need, i mean we'll have to get a desktop towards the final year for portfolio projects anyway... And you get a 240W charger in the box. So, all in all, this is gotta be the best laptop for price to performance this year. If you have the budget, then go higher, but if you're like me who has a cap of about 1 Lakh and a little wiggle room up, then this is hands down the best thing available. And you can upgrade the ssd and ram later, and maybe replace the thermal paste with liquid metal, it'll definitely improve thermals.;Laptop is good and very useful fora student and also for office usage. there is many reviewers already described about the pros. The one and only con or difficult that I faced was overheating during the charge. there is no any other problem with this laptop. Tecno has to look this issue. even if its in off condition while charging the laptop get overheated and once that i cant even touch the device.. so annoying .. after some times it was ok . the only problem persist is overheating while charging. note that i have enough ventilation underneath of my laptop..;I am having problems again and again with this and i got repaired it 7 times in 8 months. Two times keyboard replaced then motherboard replaced and now i am facing the battery issue;The ASUS TUF Gaming F15 (2023) is a solid gaming laptop that matches its online image. It boasts a bright, anti-glare 15.6\" FHD 144Hz display, enhancing your gaming experience. The laptop works fine and offers value for money with its Intel Core i7-12700H 12th Gen processor and 8GB RTX 4060 graphics. However, it could benefit from a larger SSD and tends to heat up quickly during high-intensity games.Pros:Bright Display: Enhances gaming experience.Anti-Glare Screen: Reduces eye strain.Value for Money: High-end specs at a reasonable price.Cons:Limited Storage: Comes with 512GB SSD, 1TB or 2TB would have been better.Heating Issues: Tends to heat up quickly during high-intensity games. A cooling pad is recommended.;Good item and works nicely;Excellent;This is a very good laptop with !6 GB RAM and RTX 4060. I was able to play Assassins Creed Valhalla and Remnant 2 at very high Settings. When I played Atlas Fallen at very high Settings there were some FPS drops. The sound quality is also better. I was able to process a 1080p video within 30 minutes.  The only problem that I see is the heating issue. At heavy loads, The system gets heated quickly and the fan noise is very loud. It seems it's good to use a cooling pad during heavy load tasks.",

Delivery was Swift.Pros: Good specs-- Ram 16gb,- Ryzen 7 processor 7435hs,- graphics 8gb nvidia,- FHD screen.- smooth touchpadCons: FHD screen is no big deal these days as even mobile phones have better screens. So screen is a bit of disappointment.- Plug pin is 16amp so be cautious to have separate plug point for it. Not a con as you can get an adaptor but you need to be aware of it.- Ram is mentioned 32 gb but it is 16gb only. Not sure if they will fix the description or upgrade the ram. 32 gb would have been nice with this price.- I did not try any games on this one as I wanted it for programming and vision ai which needs good GPU. Coding wise it is a really good laptop.- battery backup is good(4-5 hrs) for a gaming laptop, but I disabled most of the non-required processes.- Sound of speakers is low but okayishOverall it is value for money if it would have been 32 gb but 16 gb and only fhd is not worth the great Indian festival sale.;I love the a16. Shortlisted it after comparison with Lenovo and Asus models. G14 was a contender as well but more expensive. I also liked the size better in a16The battery runs for 10 hours while browsing, 3 hours while gaming (I played rdr 2). The fan noise is normal. Quite silent when idleWrote this review since the other reviews look a bit misleading. It says max 32 gb ram. It itself has 16. It can just be upgraded unlike g14I also run it with arch linux btw. The games are butter smooth;I recently purchased the ASUS TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition, excited by the impressive specs mentioned on the website. The laptop is marketed with 32GB RAM, which is a significant feature for gamers and heavy users like myself. However, to my disappointment, the item delivered only had 16GB of RAM instead of the promised 32GB.While the laptop performs decently with its AMD Ryzen 7 7435HS processor and AMD Radeon RTX 7600S, the lack of the advertised RAM has limited its multitasking and performance potential. The 144Hz display is smooth, and the build quality is sturdy, weighing 2.2 kg, which is manageable for a gaming laptop. But the incorrect RAM specification leaves me feeling dissatisfied.I urge ASUS and the seller to ensure they deliver the correct product as listed on the website. Overall, this could have been a great laptop if not for this significant miscommunication.;Product wise its nice and product comes with specs of R7 CPU with16GB RAM/512GB SSD/AMD Radeon RX 7600S with 90WHrs;Not 32 GB for RAM.It is 16 not 32.This is a very deceptive way of marketing things.Awful.;Got laptop with only 16 gb ram, waiting for replacement with 32gb as ordered;Good laptop better than 4050 at this price it would have been better with 7735hs processor at 75k this is a great deal",

The camera can be adjusted for image quality and microphone also works very well when talking to Alexa or Cortana.All in all its a great hardware and everyday the price has been coming down during January Sales period;Very good laptop in the budget, sound quality good, speed is good battery life very good.;It was delivered exactly on time my laptop and the packing was also very good I am very happy with it, after purchasing it from Amazon I would like to thank Amazon.;Its been 2 weeks since I bought this laptop. Super fast booting, sleek design, anti glare screen are some of the positives of this laptop. Comes with preloaded MS Office and Windows 11. Even smaller details like shutter for camera (we can actually close the camera when we aren't using the camera) have been taken care of. I absolutely love this laptop. Had one lenova laptop few years back too. Very sturdy laptops! I love this!;Display is poor.WIFI is going off all of sudden and every time we have to restart.. technical support is not able to solve the issue after 2 attempts...i would not recommend this product to anyone.;Overall, the product is quite good, but the battery drains rather quickly. Even after closing all background apps, the battery still depletes at a fast rate.;Product is good their tech support team is very cooperative and helped us in setting up the laptop.;Size very good and display is also good battery little low and processer is very fast",

The battery life is good, the sound quality, and graphics are decent enough.Go for it!;Good sleek and light Laptop with all the features as described in the product. However one small issue with the login .. sometimes suddenly it says \"You have logged in too many times incorrectly, you need to wait 15 minutes or change your login passsword\"I read about this on the Internet and realized it is a bug with the Operating system. Maybe after the next software update, this error should go away. The laptop itself is fine and has no issues.;It's a good laptop for routine work not involving much graphics. Quality of body could have been better. Speaker audio is just about adequate. Worth the money paid;I received prodcut with defective speaker, sound quality is poor even at 100% volume. When I reached out to customer care they promised technician visit which did not happen, after called them again, I was promised return of the prodcut and refund to original payment. After multiple attempts, return was not picked up and refund was not provided. Amazon customer care told me, they started investigation why carrier did not pick-up and asked me wait for couple of days for resolution.  When I called after 3 days, I was told, everything is good on their side and they can not provide refund and won't be taking return as well.  This is daylight cheating and fradualent activity.  Customer care agent will provide template response and there is no esclation matrix for grievences.  I'm going to consumer court for on this matter.;The media could not be loaded.My personal review:1.Performance(Ram-16gb)Laptop runs smoothly even when you are multitasking and handles multiple tab opening easily.If you are not a heavy gamer ( you can play casual gaming easily  as well) but insteadwant a laptop for daily or office use, you will surely like this laptop.2. DisplayThe display is more than clear enough to watch movies or any content( obviously some would argue Oled display is better;but they come at a higher price as well).3.BatteryBattery lasts for around 3 hrs on a continuous usage( battery life could be better , but it's still ok at the price range)4.SoundSound quality is also good and clear .Sound loudness is more than enough , in my above video, the music video is being played at 56 volume which itself is loud enough for me.5.HeatingPersonally , not a heavy gamer , so heating has not been an issue for me.Final Review -If you never had a laptop and is thinking of getting this laptop, go for it , you won't get a better laptop at this price range.;Speed-5 starLooks-5 starCons- very less Usb ports and no LAN portOverall best choice.;It is good laptop dedicated for work use. It is not for gaming. Display quality is 2k resolution. Sound is nice. It is giving enough battery backup. Size and weight is not too much. All together it is value for money.;In my point of this laptop is very very good because of its sound,screen,keyboard,and branding it has only one thing that is not good is it has not backlit if you think in photo it screen is not good but no my phone camera quality is not good if you think you will buy this laptop then you must and over all this laptop is so good and also have 65W charger",

The brightness peak is above 500nits which is amazing. As have my hands on 144Hz screen so it's slow response for me but that's just fine like other normal laptops.I'd recommend this if you want it for:1. Programming purpose2. Other light and mid range tasks3. Movies, editing photos and just normal use4. Presentation purpose or business work5. On the go and light weightI'd not recommended to those who:1.

            {
                "text": "The ASUS Marshmallow KW100 Keyboard is an excellent choice for those seeking a quiet, compact, and versatile wireless keyboard. Its comfortable typing experience, long battery life, and multi-device connectivity make it a great option for everyday use at home, in the office, or on the go. While it may not be suitable for users who prefer larger keyboards, it's a great choice for most users seeking a reliable and affordable wireless keyboard.;The size is compact and does not occupy much space on your workspace which is very convenient.Typing is a breeze on this keyboard and it allows fast typing owing to the less key travel and the its scissor switches. Almost feels like typing on a MacBook keyboard. Also the colours are soothing and aesthetically pleasing.However the price is a bit high. At this price range you can buy good quality mechanical keyboards but I guess the use cases are different. This keyboard is very good for speed typing but feels bit delicate for hardcore gaming. Mechanical keyboards are more durable and suitable for rugged gaming but do not offer such a good typing experience. So one must decide accordingly.I say you should go for it if you don't use it for gaming \ud83d\udc4d;The media could not be loaded.It's the best ever! So compact, so lightweight. Initially, I was a bit reluctant about how it was going to be, since things that appear this beautiful are not always the most practical. I feel so happy as I write this review using the Asus keyboard that I just received. The usage is seamless, and ah I love the feel of it! 100% recommend and worth the money. Especially for someone, who's into more minimal and non-corporate looking devices, this one's for you. I was using a keyboard by IGear before this, typewriter inspired, it was quite beautiful, but supremely bulky and had USB cable system which is honestly not very compatible with new Mac series with C-type plug in. This one barely took a minute to connect via bluetooth! Have a satisfactory motivation to study all day and utilise this keyboard \u2618\ufe0e;I bought the Green Tea Latte. It comes with a thick bunch of paperwork and 2AAA batteries. There's an on-off switch at the back. The letters are crisp and clear. The key travel is decent. It's silent. It gets into some battery-saving mode if not used for 5 to 10 mins (didn't measure). Hence, you can't start typing as it requires one stroke and a second to wake up. So, get in the habit of hitting the space bar if you don't want your documents to have typos.At this price (Rs 2899), it should have been backlit and should have come with lithium-ion batteries. If that would have made the price to Rs 3000, then it would have made more sense. Nevertheless, this is a good one.Update: The keyboard goes to sleep too fast.....and requires a keystroke to wake up, leading to typos!;The keyboard looks very good that\u2019s the only fair point they have. Pairing doesn\u2019t work. The first time I don\u2019t know how it paired with laptop but it did. F key stopped working the next week. I tried contacting Asus service centre they said \u201cthey don\u2019t deal with keyboards\u201d now am trying to pair it with my pc, been holding fn and 1 key from 10 mins it is not blinking I tried with fn+2 and fn+3 as well it didn\u2019t work. If it doesn\u2019t work in the next 15 mins might break it.;The media could not be loaded.Quality - excellent at this pricePairing and ease of use - excellentImprovements- replace batteries with rechargeable type c port, dark ink on gray keys, and should asseble body with screw so that in future easy to clean or do small repairs yourself if any.;I really like the design and the typing experience of this keyboard.But one thing that has been annoying me for past 6 months since i bought it is its wake time.So - You click on it to wake it up, it takes atleast 2 seconds to do it. And then only it will detect the future input, not the one you clicked to wake it. But that was not the case with Logitech 380 (but logi keyboard has bad key placement that you cant type in those round keys)Sometimes if you keep clicking on it to wake, it wont detect any of the keys at all, because it seems like the wake timer (2 sec approx) keep resetting after every key stroke. So if you press 7-8 keys simultaneously to start working on it, it wont detect any. You have to wait till it actually wakes up, and then you can start typing.I was quite okay with such delay, but sometimes it annoys that it cant be fixed.Few good things about it -1. No software needed. (unlike logitech keyboard, who need a software + they will track every key stroke of yours. Dont know if they even send that data to their cloud.)2. Key spacing and key travel very good.3. Quite silent if typing comfortably.4. Battery lasts long. 6 months and still running.5. Good design. Asus also sells similar color mouse to complete your set.6. Works well on macbook and ipad.7. Has inbuilt keys to switch between windows and mac key bindings.Cons1. Cant customize shortcuts on the keyboard with any utility as there is none, but personally i dont care.2. Delay in wake up time explained in the start of the review.;Has the kind of comfortable keys i was looking for, doesn\u2019t take up too much space, can connect to any device: phone, tablet or desktop, anddd it\u2019s so aesthetic.Would recommend for the girlies to grab this while it\u2019s on discount \u2728\u2728",

                "text": "I recently purchased the Dell 15 Thin & Light Laptop, and so far, I'm quite impressed. It packs a Core i5-1235U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, which makes multitasking smooth and quick. The 15.6\" FHD display is sharp and offers great visuals whether I'm streaming videos or working on documents.What stands out for me is how lightweight it is\u2014just 1.66kg\u2014making it super portable without feeling flimsy. Despite its slim design, the laptop feels sturdy, and the spill-resistant keyboard is a nice touch for added peace of mind.Another bonus is the pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office 2021, so I was ready to work right out of the box. The inclusion of 15 months of McAfee security is a nice plus, especially if you're cautious about online threats.If I had to nitpick, 8GB of RAM is decent for everyday tasks but may not be enough for more intensive work or gaming. Also, the build, while durable, does attract fingerprints, especially on the black finish.Overall, this is an excellent laptop for students, professionals, or anyone needing a reliable machine for daily use without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for its performance, portability, and value!;As soon as the 1year warranty period is over the laptop stopped working. It gets hanged or dropped out when I'm in a meeting. Also it gets hanged when I'm trying to open an excell or any file. I've been trying to reach the customer support as well but they don't take you call or respond to message. Worst customer service and worst product. Please don't buy it.;;Worth buying this, thx.;Fear that...it may blast;nice;I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare. Right out of the box, there was a glaring green dot on the screen that refuses to go away, and the camera is unstable, making it impossible to use for work or meetings.I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to help. When I contacted Dell, their so-called \"support\" team told me they could only replace the LED/ED screen and couldn\u2019t even provide me with a DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter. How does that even make sense for a brand-new product?I trusted Amazon and Dell to deliver a quality product and back it up with proper service, but I\u2019ve been left stuck in the middle with no solution. Both companies are shirking their responsibilities, and now I\u2019m stuck with a defective laptop.This is unacceptable from two major companies that are supposed to be industry leaders. I will think twice before purchasing anything from Amazon or Dell again. Buyers beware! Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.;light weight, good portability, decent looks , good built quality, battery lasts 5-6 hrs for normal use , lasts 8 hrs on battery saver mode if you do light works .  All well except one  issue that is it starts lagging /stuttering, videos get hung if you use the laptop while charging due to overheating . But this problem is solved by using better cooling solution like using laptop bottom riser while charging. Dont forget to buy a laptop riser along with this product.",

                "text": "The media could not be loaded.As a first-time laptop user, the Dell 15 has exceeded my expectations with its excellent performance and versatile features. I primarily use this laptop for trading, watching movies, and general productivity tasks, and it has proven to be more than capable for all my needs.**Performance and Display:**Equipped with an Intel 12th Gen Core i3 processor and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop delivers smooth and responsive performance, even when multitasking between multiple applications. The 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a stunning visual experience, making movies come to life and enhancing the fluidity of my trading charts.**Portability and Build Quality:**Weighing just 1.69kg and featuring a thin and lightweight design, the Dell 15 is easy to carry around, whether I'm working from home or on the go. The spill-resistant keyboard adds a layer of durability, giving me peace of mind against accidental spills during long trading sessions or movie marathons.**Value for Money:**At a price of 29k, this laptop offers exceptional value for money. With its solid performance, vibrant display, and practical features, it competes favorably with higher-priced alternatives on the market. For a first-time laptop buyer like myself, it's reassuring to know that I've made a wise investment in a reliable and versatile computing device.**Future Updates:**I plan to update this review after six months of using the Dell 15, providing valuable insights into its long-term performance, durability, and any additional features or drawbacks I may discover over time. This will be helpful for others who are considering purchasing the same laptop and are looking for real-world experiences.**Final Thoughts:**Overall, the Dell 15 has been an outstanding first laptop for me. Its combination of performance, display quality, portability, and affordability makes it an ideal choice for users looking for a versatile companion for everyday computing tasks. Whether you're a student, professional, or casual user, the Dell 15 delivers a compelling user experience that punches above its price point. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for their first laptop or a reliable upgrade.Edit: today 7 September 2024 my hinges broked but because of dell service they replaced my hinges and laptop upper body \ud83d\udc45 , Hinges were hard and after replacement they're very smooth like Amul butter. Zero rupees replacement! Just call customer care and told everything! Within 2 days engineer visit and fixed it!, check my images and videos.Overall laptop is great \ud83d\ude38! I bought this laptop only 29k because of credit card discount..;I ordered this laptop and I had received old and used laptop in open box. Orignal box was open which was kept inside good amazon outer box, so I couldn't check open box while taking laptop delivery. See below issues that I faced and need your attention so that you save your money.Open box, used laptopI order 14\" laptop and received 15.9\" display.It was getting Heat too much in this cold winter weather.When pressed power switch thrice it turns on.Some times there is black screen and only cursor visible. Twice it happened.Faulty product, was looking like refurbished computer.This seller is selling faulty product. Be aware. It's good to buy from local shop.Configuration is same as described.There are 21% , 1star review;Over all good product, Battery exhaust fast.;The media could not be loaded.It Is Very Ideal For Work And Without Lagging. Very Handy To Use, Feels Like A Book & Is Light. Very Clear Display. Very Satisfied From Amazon. We Were Initially Worried About Quality But It Is The Best By Value.You Can Go For It For Office Working. Used For 4 Hours 100% to 15% In Full Use.;Received my system on 27th February, Completed system configuration, yet to start using.Positive - Received in company (Dell) packing, and Amazon box on top of it, lot of protection inside, brand new piece, verily slim look \u2026 Overall look and feel is Brilliant\u2026Shall write more about performance once I start using itThanks everyone for your attention;I purchased this laptop on the 18th and today is the 24th. I have read a lot of reviews complaining about heating issues and yes they are right. This laptop is a heater. It will be very helpful during the winter season.But I am keeping this as I have liked it and that's why the good 3 stars I am giving.When you use any laptop for the first few days, it heats up pretty badly because of a lot of updates going on in the background. I was almost scared when I see it heats up super bad and was thinking to return it. But that was just one time. But still, it heats up more than a normal laptop should. I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work. I just purchased it as a backup laptop because my main laptop Asus Vivobook runs 14 to 18hrs a day for the last 5 yrs and it needs some rest.Personally, I won't recommend this laptop. Maybe try Asus or HP. Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though. Will update after 4-5 months of usage and re-write proper review after 1 year of usageEdit: 21st August 2024.Well, on 14th August, 2024, laptop stopped working. I sent it to Dell repair and found motherboard is dead. They need to replace it whole.So I am not recommending this laptop. People say right. Never bought expensive stuffs online. This is 4th laptop and 1st online and so huge issue. Motherboard estimation is 16500 right now. Luckily I have insurance, I am not sure how much will they cover. My Asus, HP, Compaq and Macbook never got motherboard issue and all lasted long. This one gave so big issues even from start and now look at it.",

                "text": "Update Oct 2021: At first, I thought it was a driver issue with Windows 11, but no i think the enclosure has gone bad. This drive has been causing my system to freeze up and I keep getting Blue Screen errors since the OS update. I tried multiple working NVMe drives, a Samsung 960Evo and and Kingston A2000. I even tried it on Linux, drive still freezes and causes kernel panic. Lasted less than a year. I'll try to RMA it with Asus.Original Review April 2021: I like the design, and assembly is easy enough. Full body aluminum should work well for heat dissipation. Works well, transfers are pretty fast as you'd expect. I didn't do speed tests, because i frankly couldn't care enough.One odd thing i noticed was about the included cables. The USB-C to A cable is labeled as USB 3.0 (so USB 3.2 Gen 1), and the USB C to C is USB 3.1 (USB 3.2 Gen 2). The enclosure is rated as USB 3.2 Gen 2, so I would assume the included cable should have the same rating. I haven't gotten around to testing if it actually makes any difference, but theoretically Gen 1 is half the speed of Gen 2. Maybe I'll do it eventually and then update this review.A sim ejector like tool for opening the case would not have been my first choice. It is easy to lose and you'll be left looking for one down the line if you need to change out the drives.;The media could not be loaded.Best Ext SSD enclosure ever. Worth of money. A true gamer can feel it as soon you hold it;My internal SSD has a case now that is stylish yet compact, built out of aluminum, this is durable and does not even warm up during extended periods of usage;Package came intact with a seal on the box.Very well designed and full metal body construction. Thermal pads provided inside the case. Comes with high data transfer USB C/ A cables. A edge protector 'rubber case' for the CASE provided and an R-Clip to attach the unit to your laptop bag (perhaps). Accessing inside the case is also made easy with a pin push to open type arrangement.The propriety screw provided was not well designed. When the SSD biscuit is inserted inside and the screw tightened, the case would not close. After investigation found that the screw head was unnecessarily big causing the problem...Had to find another screw and jerry rig the connection to make it work!!!***Update: All is good with the screw the ssd biscuit sits in the screw notch provided (see attached pics).After 2 hrs of continuous gaming and 200 GB's of data transfer the SSD temps were below the 45 Deg C mark which is really good.  I got a healthy data transfer rate of 550 GBps on my WD 1TB SSD which is sufficient for gaming.Verdict :  A bit expensive for what you are getting here. Only would recommend if you are a Tech enthusiast, own Asus products or simply like all things RGB....;This ROG Case is best for gammer and Editor. SSD easily install in case and plug in  play work. No more software requirements for use this case. SSD data transfer speed using this  case is almost 1gbps.;Solid product, worked like a charm for me. Cloned my 250 gb sdd to a 1 tb verbatim SSD and booted up my higher capacity laptop without issue. Didn't heat up much either during the procedure which is good. People should know however that this case has issues with the crucial p5 sdd, so if u have one of those don't buy this. I'll keep my 250 GB western digital safe somewhere as backup and purchase another SSD to use with this enclosure for regular file transfer. Happy customer here \ud83d\ude42;PLEASE CHECK THE SELLER NAME BEFORE BUYING.DON'T BUY THIS FROM KICK TECHNOLOGY.I received an opened package with craft taped. Quick release pin and cables were missing so I returned it(since I didn't get an option to replace it\ud83d\ude44).Then I bought this on MD Computers' website.Product is pretty great. Used this with Crucial P5 plus SSD for my video editing work (Premiere Pro & After Effects). Works great with my STRIX G17 laptop.;Heats up quick but so far no drop in the read or write speed provided you use good short type C cable.Aluminium casing make it light weight and looks perfect with that Matt finish black;This ASUS SSD enclosure is simply outstanding! From the sleek, premium design to the blazing-fast speeds, it outperforms any other enclosure I\u2019ve used\u2014including my UGREEN SSD enclosure, which doesn\u2019t even come close in terms of performance and build quality.The installation was effortless, and the transfer speeds are exactly as advertised\u2014super fast and reliable. Whether for gaming, work, or backups, this enclosure handles everything flawlessly. If you\u2019re looking for a high-quality SSD enclosure, this is the one to get. Highly recommended!;The aluminum alloy build feels premium, keeps the drive cool, and the RGB lighting adds style. Setup is tool-free and simple, and the USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ensures blazing-fast speeds\u2014perfect for large file transfers.A bit pricey, but the quality and performance make it worth it. Highly recommended for anyone needing a durable and stylish SSD enclosure!;Comprei o kit do Asus Airon mais um bag para ele em conjunto, produto muito bem feito, com bom acabamento, bem pr\u00e1tico!;Como cualquier otro case/adaptador, cumple con su funci\u00f3n principal de forma eficiente, logrando obtener un aproximado a las velocidades indicadas por el fabricante y con la facilidad de instalaci\u00f3n que se presume, algo que lo diferencia bastante son los materiales que lo consolidan, me agrada mucho que este hecho de aluminio, eso le ayuda a disipar el calor que generan los SSD y gracias a los \u2018thermal pads\u2019 de su interior esto es mas eficiente.Las luces ya son algo est\u00e9tico que luce bien cuando se conecta y te puede servir como aviso de que sigue conectado.Algo que si veo un poco innecesario es el gancho, hay que ser bastante confiado e ingenuo para colgarlo fuera de una mochila, por dos razones, la primera es que el gancho \u2018R\u2019 este hecho de pl\u00e1stico que se ve y se siente bastante fr\u00e1gil un jal\u00f3n podr\u00eda f\u00e1cilmente romperlo, y la segunda es que se sujeta por un velcro el cual es igual de f\u00e1cil de abrir o quitar.;GOOD QUALITY.

                "text": "After using this lap for over 4-5 months, here's my verdict. I would recommend getting an extra 4GB ram upgrade as at least 8GB ram is required if you want the laptop to run very smoothly. The processor for this price is okay and can be used for most of the work but I would definitely recommend you guys getting a ram upgrade as 4GB ram isn't enough if you're a person who does multitasking. Camera quality is very bad and battery backup is alright for this price and will last for over 5-6 hours of continuous usage under heavy workload. Overall would recommend buying it but definitely ram upgrade is a must.;I brought this for heavy excel use and office work things.As far now its working great.Battery  backup is very good about 6hrs. As its new machine.Light weight.8gb of ram fulfils my requirements  of excel use.Easy to carry in bag.Light weight charger with it.Fulfils all my needs so im happy  with it.;ITS A BASIC LAPTOPNOT WORTHY FOR ANY SPECIFIC EDITING OR ANY SUCH PURPOSEMY OLD 2019 LAPTOP with i5 8th GENERATION is working better than thisFilmora EDitor doesnt work as of graphics driver issue.Speed comparitively lowSuitable for basic Office jobs, word excel, video conf, chats, internet surfing etc...Dont buy if u have any specific job to perform. Buy minimum i5 for any such jobs..;It's amazing product.i just loved it. This laptop is use for students and office work it's an basic use .u can buy it without second thought on base of the way u use.......for basic use its best;Wifi problemCharger no life;Over all good one. But the main issue is 4GB ram for windows 10 will not be good enough. You have to add more ram. Literally, it is tough to find a 3200 mhz laptop ram in the market. But increasing the ram will be a must, to use multiple app at the same time!If you are ok to wait for a minute or two to load any application, then go for this laptop. If not, you need to spend another 3k or 4k for a NVME SSD. But that worth the bucks. You will see an entirely new performance with respect to Boot time, application opening and etc.;Well done;",

                "text": "I recently purchased the Dell 15 Thin & Light Laptop, and so far, I'm quite impressed. It packs a Core i5-1235U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, which makes multitasking smooth and quick. The 15.6\" FHD display is sharp and offers great visuals whether I'm streaming videos or working on documents.What stands out for me is how lightweight it is\u2014just 1.66kg\u2014making it super portable without feeling flimsy. Despite its slim design, the laptop feels sturdy, and the spill-resistant keyboard is a nice touch for added peace of mind.Another bonus is the pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office 2021, so I was ready to work right out of the box. The inclusion of 15 months of McAfee security is a nice plus, especially if you're cautious about online threats.If I had to nitpick, 8GB of RAM is decent for everyday tasks but may not be enough for more intensive work or gaming. Also, the build, while durable, does attract fingerprints, especially on the black finish.Overall, this is an excellent laptop for students, professionals, or anyone needing a reliable machine for daily use without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for its performance, portability, and value!;As soon as the 1year warranty period is over the laptop stopped working. It gets hanged or dropped out when I'm in a meeting. Also it gets hanged when I'm trying to open an excell or any file. I've been trying to reach the customer support as well but they don't take you call or respond to message. Worst customer service and worst product. Please don't buy it.;;Worth buying this, thx.;Fear that...it may blast;nice;I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare. Right out of the box, there was a glaring green dot on the screen that refuses to go away, and the camera is unstable, making it impossible to use for work or meetings.I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to help. When I contacted Dell, their so-called \"support\" team told me they could only replace the LED/ED screen and couldn\u2019t even provide me with a DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter. How does that even make sense for a brand-new product?I trusted Amazon and Dell to deliver a quality product and back it up with proper service, but I\u2019ve been left stuck in the middle with no solution. Both companies are shirking their responsibilities, and now I\u2019m stuck with a defective laptop.This is unacceptable from two major companies that are supposed to be industry leaders. I will think twice before purchasing anything from Amazon or Dell again. Buyers beware! Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.;light weight, good portability, decent looks , good built quality, battery lasts 5-6 hrs for normal use , lasts 8 hrs on battery saver mode if you do light works .  All well except one  issue that is it starts lagging /stuttering, videos get hung if you use the laptop while charging due to overheating . But this problem is solved by using better cooling solution like using laptop bottom riser while charging. Dont forget to buy a laptop riser along with this product.",

No damage or scratches..;Thank you Amazon for delivery product without any failure.I would suggest,it's a one of best laptop for daily usage work, it's consist with i5 processor, 8gb ram, with pre installated Ms office students version.Sound quality good.Looks are in average.180 dimensions can be utilisedBattery life  is an average,only 3 hours capacity, it may consider as a drawback in its performance.Fingerprint sensor not available in this product.Build quality over-all satisfaction, to be handled carefully.Thanking you;Delivered a defective product and from there on it was a hell of an experience. Amazon wouldn\u2019t do anything but ask to visit brand service center no matter where it is located. The brand technician inspected the product and gave the service form but still Amazon did not accept it. They say that there is a denial letter and this is not the same.

But motherboard packaging is worst it can damage very easily;If price ls are high wait for few days andWith the card discount and everything it's worth it I bought it for 11.5k and in this price the v rams are good and better then the gigabyte b760 which feels cheaper and only advantage is that it has type c other wise looks and feels cheap and this has a very good build quality and a bios update is pretty easy. 100% recommended;Things to note:1. VRM seems to be pretty average (No mention of it in any Official Asus documentation)2. Has Mediatek WiFi and Bluetooth Module (It's fine)3. Has only two RAM Slots, but can run 6000CL30 with XMP without any issues (Tested on 14400)4. No front panel USB-C Header5. There are no on-board LED indicators6. I wouldn't recommend this to be used with anything above 12700K/13600K7. Some air coolers (I tested with Cooler Master Hyper 212) might have clearance issues with RGB Memory kits (See image)8. It has only 2 System Fan headersOverall- Decent mobo if you're going to get a 12400/13400/14400/13500.;Used in my system upgrade with 12th gen i7 and 64 gb Ram",

This laptop is a true powerhouse, designed to deliver an exceptional gaming experience and handle demanding tasks with ease.**Performance:**Equipped with the AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS processor and an 8GB Radeon RX 7600S GPU, this laptop handles everything I throw at it, from high-end games to heavy multitasking, without breaking a sweat. The 16GB of RAM ensures smooth performance, and the 1TB SSD provides lightning-fast load times and ample storage for all my games and files.**Display:**The 16\" FHD+ display with a 165Hz refresh rate is simply stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the high refresh rate makes gameplay buttery smooth. Whether I'm playing fast-paced FPS games or enjoying rich, detailed RPGs, the visuals are always crisp and immersive.Battery Life:One of the standout features is the 90WHr battery, which offers impressive longevity for a gaming laptop. I can easily get several hours of gaming on a single charge, which is fantastic for those long sessions away from a power outlet. The battery life is also excellent for productivity tasks, lasting even longer when I'm not gaming.Build Quality:The TUF series lives up to its name with a robust and durable build. The laptop feels solid in hand, and despite being a gaming machine, it\u2019s relatively portable at 2.20 kg. The design is sleek and aggressive, fitting the gaming aesthetic perfectly.Software and Extras:Windows 11 and Office 2021 come pre-installed, making it ready to go right out of the box. The software runs flawlessly, and I appreciate not having to deal with bloatware. The addition of Office 2021 is a nice touch for productivity on the go.Cooling and Noise:The cooling system is highly efficient, keeping the laptop at optimal temperatures even during intense gaming sessions. The fans can get a bit loud under heavy load, but that's to be expected from a high-performance gaming laptop.**Conclusion:**The ASUS TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition (2023) is a top-tier gaming laptop that offers excellent value for money. With its powerful hardware, stunning display, long-lasting battery, and solid build quality, it's hard to find a better option in this price range. Whether you're a hardcore gamer or need a capable machine for demanding tasks, this laptop won't disappoint.",

                "text": "I have been using this Silent Mouse, and it has quickly become my go-to for both work and casual gaming.Pros:\u2022 Quiet Clicks: The silent click feature is a game-changer, allowing me to work in shared spaces without disturbing others.\u2022 Comfortable Design: The ergonomic shape fits comfortably in my hand, reducing fatigue during long sessions.\u2022 Responsive Tracking: The sensor is accurate and performs well on various surfaces, making it suitable for both everyday tasks and gaming.\u2022 Battery Life: The battery lasts a long time, and it uses a convenient USB receiver, eliminating the need for frequent recharging.Cons:\u2022 Limited Customization: While it works great out of the box, advanced users might find the lack of programmable buttons a drawback.\u2022 Size: It may be a bit small for users with larger hands, hence NOT IDEAL for SERIOUS GAMERSOverall, the Asus Silent Mouse is an excellent choice for anyone seeking a quiet, comfortable, and reliable mouse. It combines functionality with a thoughtful design, making it perfect for both office work and casual gaming. Highly recommended!;The ASUS Marshmallow Mouse MD100 Steven Harrington Edition is not just an ordinary wireless mouse; it is a combination of style, performance, and quiet operation. This limited edition mouse, designed in collaboration with artist Steven Harrington, stands out as a unique and fun addition to any tech setup while maintaining solid functionality for everyday use.Design & Aesthetic:What immediately grabs attention is the vibrant, art-inspired design. Steven Harrington\u2019s playful and surreal style is imprinted on the mouse, adding a touch of personality to an otherwise mundane tech accessory. The compact, lightweight build (weighing just 56g) makes it ideal for portability, fitting comfortably into backpacks or laptop bags without adding bulk. The feel in the hand is comfortable, especially for those who prefer smaller mice, and it\u2019s an eye-catching accessory whether you\u2019re at the office or working remotely.Silent Clicks:One of the standout features of the MD100 is its silent operation. The buttons produce virtually no clicking noise, making it a great choice for quiet environments such as libraries, meetings, or late-night work sessions. This \u201csilent click\u201d design delivers the same responsiveness without the distracting noise of a traditional mouse, which can be a game-changer for professionals who share workspaces.Adjustable DPI and Performance:Functionality is where this mouse continues to shine. With adjustable DPI (Dots Per Inch) settings, ranging from 800 to 1600 DPI, users can easily switch between precision tasks (like photo editing) and general browsing or office work. The sensitivity adjustment is a useful feature, allowing for customized control depending on your task or personal preference.The optical sensor is highly responsive across different surfaces, including mouse pads and standard desks. While it\u2019s not a gaming mouse, the performance is more than adequate for general productivity and creative tasks.Multi-Mode Connectivity:The MD100 is versatile when it comes to connectivity. It supports both 2.4GHz wireless (via USB receiver) and Bluetooth, making it compatible with a wide range of devices from desktops and laptops to tablets. Switching between devices is seamless, and the setup process is straightforward. The multi-mode functionality makes it a solid option for users who juggle multiple devices regularly. However, it should be noted that there\u2019s no USB-C dongle included for newer laptops, which is a minor downside.Battery Life:ASUS claims an impressive battery life of up to one year on a single AA battery, depending on usage. For most users, this means the mouse will run for months without needing a replacement. The battery compartment is easy to access, and the mouse features an automatic sleep mode to conserve power when not in use.Ergonomics:Due to its small size, the ASUS Marshmallow MD100 is better suited for users with smaller hands or those who prefer claw or fingertip grip styles. For larger hands or those who require a more ergonomically shaped mouse for long sessions, this might not be the most comfortable option. However, the weight and portability make it a go-to mouse for travel or on-the-go use.Drawbacks:While the Steven Harrington design is a definite plus for those who appreciate artistic collaborations, it might not appeal to those looking for a more minimalist, professional look. Additionally, the lack of an included USB-C adapter could be inconvenient for users with newer devices.Conclusion:The ASUS Marshmallow Mouse MD100 Steven Harrington Edition is more than just a visually appealing gadget. It blends essential features like silent operation, multi-device connectivity, and adjustable DPI into a portable, stylish package. For those seeking a compact, quiet mouse with an artistic flair, this limited edition is a fantastic choice. However, users with larger hands or specific ergonomic needs may want to consider other options.Rating: 4.5/5;Light weight. Good looking. Good tactile clicks. Good size. Fits into my hand very easily. Good texture. Good scroll wheel. Good connectivity options: wifi, bt, usb. Only issue is my mouse turns off all of a sudden and I need to remove the battery and install it again for it to turn back again. Other than this minor inconvenience, good product.;This is an awesome mouse. Great price and great value for money plus good quality. The mouse is sleek, allows me to shift between my laptop and iPad using either radio frequency with an USB dongle or Bluetooth. Connecting and transferring between the two is just a simple flip of a small switch underneath. Very well designed and made.;Must buy, it's beat wireless mouse I have used under this budget, it's very silent, great texture and size.",

The battery life is good, the sound quality, and graphics are decent enough.Go for it!;Good sleek and light Laptop with all the features as described in the product. However one small issue with the login .. sometimes suddenly it says \"You have logged in too many times incorrectly, you need to wait 15 minutes or change your login passsword\"I read about this on the Internet and realized it is a bug with the Operating system. Maybe after the next software update, this error should go away. The laptop itself is fine and has no issues.;It's a good laptop for routine work not involving much graphics. Quality of body could have been better. Speaker audio is just about adequate. Worth the money paid;I received prodcut with defective speaker, sound quality is poor even at 100% volume. When I reached out to customer care they promised technician visit which did not happen, after called them again, I was promised return of the prodcut and refund to original payment. After multiple attempts, return was not picked up and refund was not provided. Amazon customer care told me, they started investigation why carrier did not pick-up and asked me wait for couple of days for resolution.  When I called after 3 days, I was told, everything is good on their side and they can not provide refund and won't be taking return as well.  This is daylight cheating and fradualent activity.  Customer care agent will provide template response and there is no esclation matrix for grievences.  I'm going to consumer court for on this matter.;The media could not be loaded.My personal review:1.Performance(Ram-16gb)Laptop runs smoothly even when you are multitasking and handles multiple tab opening easily.If you are not a heavy gamer ( you can play casual gaming easily  as well) but insteadwant a laptop for daily or office use, you will surely like this laptop.2. DisplayThe display is more than clear enough to watch movies or any content( obviously some would argue Oled display is better;but they come at a higher price as well).3.BatteryBattery lasts for around 3 hrs on a continuous usage( battery life could be better , but it's still ok at the price range)4.SoundSound quality is also good and clear .Sound loudness is more than enough , in my above video, the music video is being played at 56 volume which itself is loud enough for me.5.HeatingPersonally , not a heavy gamer , so heating has not been an issue for me.Final Review -If you never had a laptop and is thinking of getting this laptop, go for it , you won't get a better laptop at this price range.;Speed-5 starLooks-5 starCons- very less Usb ports and no LAN portOverall best choice.;It is good laptop dedicated for work use. It is not for gaming. Display quality is 2k resolution. Sound is nice. It is giving enough battery backup. Size and weight is not too much. All together it is value for money.;In my point of this laptop is very very good because of its sound,screen,keyboard,and branding it has only one thing that is not good is it has not backlit if you think in photo it screen is not good but no my phone camera quality is not good if you think you will buy this laptop then you must and over all this laptop is so good and also have 65W charger",

I primarily use this laptop for trading, watching movies, and general productivity tasks, and it has proven to be more than capable for all my needs.**Performance and Display:**Equipped with an Intel 12th Gen Core i3 processor and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop delivers smooth and responsive performance, even when multitasking between multiple applications. The 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a stunning visual experience, making movies come to life and enhancing the fluidity of my trading charts.**Portability and Build Quality:**Weighing just 1.69kg and featuring a thin and lightweight design, the Dell 15 is easy to carry around, whether I'm working from home or on the go. The spill-resistant keyboard adds a layer of durability, giving me peace of mind against accidental spills during long trading sessions or movie marathons.**Value for Money:**At a price of 29k, this laptop offers exceptional value for money. With its solid performance, vibrant display, and practical features, it competes favorably with higher-priced alternatives on the market. For a first-time laptop buyer like myself, it's reassuring to know that I've made a wise investment in a reliable and versatile computing device.**Future Updates:**I plan to update this review after six months of using the Dell 15, providing valuable insights into its long-term performance, durability, and any additional features or drawbacks I may discover over time. This will be helpful for others who are considering purchasing the same laptop and are looking for real-world experiences.**Final Thoughts:**Overall, the Dell 15 has been an outstanding first laptop for me. Its combination of performance, display quality, portability, and affordability makes it an ideal choice for users looking for a versatile companion for everyday computing tasks. Whether you're a student, professional, or casual user, the Dell 15 delivers a compelling user experience that punches above its price point. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for their first laptop or a reliable upgrade.Edit: today 7 September 2024 my hinges broked but because of dell service they replaced my hinges and laptop upper body \ud83d\udc45 , Hinges were hard and after replacement they're very smooth like Amul butter. Zero rupees replacement! Just call customer care and told everything! Within 2 days engineer visit and fixed it!, check my images and videos.Overall laptop is great \ud83d\ude38! I bought this laptop only 29k because of credit card discount..;I ordered this laptop and I had received old and used laptop in open box. Orignal box was open which was kept inside good amazon outer box, so I couldn't check open box while taking laptop delivery. See below issues that I faced and need your attention so that you save your money.Open box, used laptopI order 14\" laptop and received 15.9\" display.It was getting Heat too much in this cold winter weather.When pressed power switch thrice it turns on.Some times there is black screen and only cursor visible. Twice it happened.Faulty product, was looking like refurbished computer.This seller is selling faulty product. Be aware. It's good to buy from local shop.Configuration is same as described.There are 21% , 1star review;Over all good product, Battery exhaust fast.;The media could not be loaded.It Is Very Ideal For Work And Without Lagging. Very Handy To Use, Feels Like A Book & Is Light. Very Clear Display. Very Satisfied From Amazon. We Were Initially Worried About Quality But It Is The Best By Value.You Can Go For It For Office Working. Used For 4 Hours 100% to 15% In Full Use.;Received my system on 27th February, Completed system configuration, yet to start using.Positive - Received in company (Dell) packing, and Amazon box on top of it, lot of protection inside, brand new piece, verily slim look \u2026 Overall look and feel is Brilliant\u2026Shall write more about performance once I start using itThanks everyone for your attention;I purchased this laptop on the 18th and today is the 24th. I have read a lot of reviews complaining about heating issues and yes they are right. This laptop is a heater. It will be very helpful during the winter season.But I am keeping this as I have liked it and that's why the good 3 stars I am giving.When you use any laptop for the first few days, it heats up pretty badly because of a lot of updates going on in the background. I was almost scared when I see it heats up super bad and was thinking to return it. But that was just one time. But still, it heats up more than a normal laptop should. I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work. I just purchased it as a backup laptop because my main laptop Asus Vivobook runs 14 to 18hrs a day for the last 5 yrs and it needs some rest.Personally, I won't recommend this laptop. Maybe try Asus or HP. Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though. Will update after 4-5 months of usage and re-write proper review after 1 year of usageEdit: 21st August 2024.Well, on 14th August, 2024, laptop stopped working. I sent it to Dell repair and found motherboard is dead. They need to replace it whole.So I am not recommending this laptop. People say right. Never bought expensive stuffs online. This is 4th laptop and 1st online and so huge issue. Motherboard estimation is 16500 right now. Luckily I have insurance, I am not sure how much will they cover. My Asus, HP, Compaq and Macbook never got motherboard issue and all lasted long. This one gave so big issues even from start and now look at it.",

Whether you're a student, professional, or casual user, the Dell 15 delivers a compelling user experience that punches above its price point. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for their first laptop or a reliable upgrade.Edit: today 7 September 2024 my hinges broked but because of dell service they replaced my hinges and laptop upper body \ud83d\udc45 , Hinges were hard and after replacement they're very smooth like Amul butter.

I have read a lot of reviews complaining about heating issues and yes they are right. This laptop is a heater. It will be very helpful during the winter season.But I am keeping this as I have liked it and that's why the good 3 stars I am giving.When you use any laptop for the first few days, it heats up pretty badly because of a lot of updates going on in the background. I was almost scared when I see it heats up super bad and was thinking to return it. But that was just one time. But still, it heats up more than a normal laptop should. I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work. I just purchased it as a backup laptop because my main laptop Asus Vivobook runs 14 to 18hrs a day for the last 5 yrs and it needs some rest.Personally, I won't recommend this laptop. Maybe try Asus or HP. Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though. Will update after 4-5 months of usage and re-write proper review after 1 year of usageEdit: 21st August 2024.Well, on 14th August, 2024, laptop stopped working. I sent it to Dell repair and found motherboard is dead. They need to replace it whole.So I am not recommending this laptop. People say right. Never bought expensive stuffs online. This is 4th laptop and 1st online and so huge issue. Motherboard estimation is 16500 right now. Luckily I have insurance, I am not sure how much will they cover. My Asus, HP, Compaq and Macbook never got motherboard issue and all lasted long. This one gave so big issues even from start and now look at it.",

I primarily use this laptop for trading, watching movies, and general productivity tasks, and it has proven to be more than capable for all my needs.**Performance and Display:**Equipped with an Intel 12th Gen Core i3 processor and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop delivers smooth and responsive performance, even when multitasking between multiple applications. The 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a stunning visual experience, making movies come to life and enhancing the fluidity of my trading charts.**Portability and Build Quality:**Weighing just 1.69kg and featuring a thin and lightweight design, the Dell 15 is easy to carry around, whether I'm working from home or on the go. The spill-resistant keyboard adds a layer of durability, giving me peace of mind against accidental spills during long trading sessions or movie marathons.**Value for Money:**At a price of 29k, this laptop offers exceptional value for money. With its solid performance, vibrant display, and practical features, it competes favorably with higher-priced alternatives on the market. For a first-time laptop buyer like myself, it's reassuring to know that I've made a wise investment in a reliable and versatile computing device.**Future Updates:**I plan to update this review after six months of using the Dell 15, providing valuable insights into its long-term performance, durability, and any additional features or drawbacks I may discover over time. This will be helpful for others who are considering purchasing the same laptop and are looking for real-world experiences.**Final Thoughts:**Overall, the Dell 15 has been an outstanding first laptop for me.

                "text": "### Review for Refurbished Dell Optiplex 7040 Mini PC#### Performance and SpecificationsThe refurbished Dell Optiplex 7040 Mini PC offers a robust performance packed into a compact design, making it an excellent choice for both home and office use.

It provides all the essential features needed for a smooth computing experience, backed by reliable Dell hardware. The refurbishment process ensures that the product is restored to excellent working condition, making it a sustainable and economical choice.#### Pros:- Powerful 6th gen Intel Core i5 processor- 16 GB DDR4 RAM for efficient multitasking- Fast 512 GB SSD storage- Pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office- Compact and sleek design- Good connectivity options with USB, Ethernet, and DP#### Cons:- As a refurbished product, potential buyers should verify the warranty and return policy- Intel HD Graphics may not be suitable for high-end gaming or intensive graphic design tasksOverall, the Dell Optiplex 7040 Mini PC stands out as a reliable, high-performance machine that caters to a wide range of computing needs, all while maintaining a compact footprint and offering great value for its price.;ISSUE WITH THE PRODUCT & THE REPLACEMENT PROCESS:The machine I received was faulty, it made a lot of noise (as if an electric saw in buzzing from inside) & it was missing WiFi 5G connection capabilities (because of the WiFi adaptor they sent with it).I raised a request for replacement but the process has been an unnecessarily challenging experience.It seems like an elaborate scheme to just sell customers non-working low quality products.I would strongly discourage anyone to buy from them.;I was initially hesitant to buy this Dell Mini PC because I thought I might be getting a refurbished unit. The first two days were a bit concerning as the device was making a lot of noise. However, after the system completed all its updates, the noise stopped completely, and it's been quiet since then.I also had an issue with the PC randomly restarting, but I called customer support, and they were extremely helpful. The representative immediately tried to resolve the issue, which gave me the confidence I needed to keep the product after Amazon's 7-day replacement window had passed.One thing that surprised me was that my variant actually came with a built-in speaker, which was a nice bonus! However, I did face some issues with the WiFi dongle that frequently disconnected and limited my speed to 20-30Mbps, even though I have a 200Mbps Airtel connection. To fix this, I ordered a TP-Link 600 Mbps WiFi adapter, and it\u2019s been working perfectly, giving me the full 200Mbps speed.Another great thing is that both Windows and Office were activated, which is definitely a plus! All of this for 10-11K, and I\u2019m really happy with the value I\u2019ve received.Now, I\u2019m optimistic. If it continues to work smoothly for 6 months, I\u2019ll be confident it\u2019ll last much longer. For now, I\u2019m happy with my purchase!;Good qualityGood for only office workWifi includedBluetooth not includedAll usb ports are workingValue for moneySmall inbuilt speakerWindows 11 pre installedGood performance for office tasks in office appsNot for gaming or editing;A refurbished product which feels like new with no performance issues of any sorts! Very powerful and compact designed product best suited for budgeted workstations with no performance compromise.Excellent customer service with video call troubleshooting to fix any and all minor issues without any hassles. Only need to ship product in case of major hardware issue which I haven't come across yet !;It is a very poor product, its Wi-Fi is not connected, in the last you can see, I have to manually collect my Wi-Fi from the wire, its display turns off automatically and I called customer support and got help from Amazon. Got it but the person who was transferred later was such a bad personDidn't get any response from them and told me that they will give you a response after 48 hours, what check will it be changed or repaired or will it be fixed, neither any response came nor any reply came nor returned, at last out of compulsion I have to run a lot. my are having a bad experience, please think carefully not purchased thi product;Great product....working fine...as promised....i5 6th gen/16gbram/512ssd/windows 11 pro/ms office 16 provided in the package ...wifi/bluetooth/inbuilt speaker...all in there..no wear and tear as such on the machine.I have ordered cooling pad for this mini pc. Working as charm.Minor issue was with the 3-pin cable provided..rest all good. Worth buying.",

It offers good performance, a compact design, and a reasonable price. While it may not be the most powerful but it sulrely a  feature-rich laptop on the market, it's a great option for everyday tasks and casual users and students also;I purchased this product since the webcam of the last laptop i was using got spoilt. Though I felt this product was slightly on the expensive side, it gave me all the specs I was looking for. I loved the look and feel of this laptop and the performance so far has been pretty good. Just one observation.. I wanted to place a webcam protector/ slider cover, but so far, I'm unable to find any which fits due to the narrow borders.;Vey good laptop with high refresh rate and with a good user interface experience. If you are a student and a programmer i definitely would recommend this. If you are an editor you can have a look on this. Coming back to batter it last up to 3-4 hours which is okayish. Over all i would give 4.9/5 .#bestfromdell #amazingfromdell #dell;Writing review for Amazon service.Amazon has recently changed their policy with laptops, they don't allow you to return the product anymore.I had a really really bad experience with their service and even being a prime member didn't make any difference.so firstly the packaging was open, then laptop started behaving weirdly, I was seeing black screen at random while working on the laptop. Thirdly when I ran benchmark test software on the laptop I received it performed very poorly (24th percentile) when compared with same laptops around the globe (I suspected this when I observed that the laptop was performing slow & laggy)I first talked to DELL service centre, the told me that they don't replace laptops, thereafter, the amazon representative requested for a technician for me. First technician marked that the issue was resolved but actually it wasn't. So I had to request for an another technician. Second technician arrived and told me that he has reported the issue with the laptop and filed for a return from his side, but he actually marked the issue as resolved without filling any return. After that I waited for whole day waiting for Amazon representative but he didn't call even after assuring me that he takes full responsibility of my issue.So I had to call Amazon again, had to explain the whole thing again to 3 different Amazon representative. Again I got promised by an Amazon Representative that they will help me resolve the issue and call me back but NO ONE called.So I had to again call Amazon once again, had to explain the same thing again and now I am stuck because they don't send technician the third time and since both technicians have marked the issue as resolved Amazon has denied to help. So I am basically stuck with this laptop and have lost 65K just like that and laptop is of no use to me.I have ordered many times from Amazon but never have I expected that a brand which portrays itself to be consumer focused would do to someone who has been their user from a long time.;Worth purchase;Laptop recd before the committed time. As it is a new product, comenting on battery life is too early. Working on tally software is a tedious job as kayboard backlight is not working while working on tally and some other softwares. Touchpad is very sensetive and unnecessary opens other dialog boxes. Display screen goes beyond the laptop surface edges when open and every time there is a risk of damages of display's hinges.;Laptop is lightweight and excellent battery..but right speaker is making distorted sound;I am using this from last 20 days, after that I am reviewing it, it is super fast laptop, high performance, multi tasking, and most importantly Battery performance is at Best.I can do coding upto 7 hours after one charged .so all in all i found it very good product. I suggest that .",

I think at this price point it is a total value for money considering that its Dell Brand.;Laptop delivered with scratches on it. Amazon packaging was good.Update after 2 month usage. New windows 11 update received. System became more stableDisplay WVA display giving good contrast.

Illuminated keyboard willbe apprecated.Good Performance, but ram is just 2666mhz only, not 3200One open hdd slot and 1 Ram slot available.Battery 41wh2 hours on heavy use,around 6 hours plus on office work.Sceptical about hinges, previously there were issues with hinges, not sure about the current situation.No type c port.I conducted a detailed study amoung i3 laptops before purchasing, and finalised between hp and dell. Only dell has ssd heat sink, see the pic attached.Overall good buy. Recommended;This product is not qualitative it's damaged in least time;Very poor video quality;Have been using the laptop for about 10 months now and I am happy with the performance. Initially there was a battery failure which I got replaced, thanks for the technical support.;Sound quality is too good but for gaming not suitable;Great laptop with all above mid range features.

                "text": "I recently purchased the Dell 15 Thin & Light Laptop, and so far, I'm quite impressed. It packs a Core i5-1235U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, which makes multitasking smooth and quick. The 15.6\" FHD display is sharp and offers great visuals whether I'm streaming videos or working on documents.What stands out for me is how lightweight it is\u2014just 1.66kg\u2014making it super portable without feeling flimsy. Despite its slim design, the laptop feels sturdy, and the spill-resistant keyboard is a nice touch for added peace of mind.Another bonus is the pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office 2021, so I was ready to work right out of the box. The inclusion of 15 months of McAfee security is a nice plus, especially if you're cautious about online threats.If I had to nitpick, 8GB of RAM is decent for everyday tasks but may not be enough for more intensive work or gaming. Also, the build, while durable, does attract fingerprints, especially on the black finish.Overall, this is an excellent laptop for students, professionals, or anyone needing a reliable machine for daily use without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for its performance, portability, and value!;As soon as the 1year warranty period is over the laptop stopped working. It gets hanged or dropped out when I'm in a meeting. Also it gets hanged when I'm trying to open an excell or any file. I've been trying to reach the customer support as well but they don't take you call or respond to message. Worst customer service and worst product. Please don't buy it.;;Worth buying this, thx.;Fear that...it may blast;nice;I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare. Right out of the box, there was a glaring green dot on the screen that refuses to go away, and the camera is unstable, making it impossible to use for work or meetings.I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to help. When I contacted Dell, their so-called \"support\" team told me they could only replace the LED/ED screen and couldn\u2019t even provide me with a DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter. How does that even make sense for a brand-new product?I trusted Amazon and Dell to deliver a quality product and back it up with proper service, but I\u2019ve been left stuck in the middle with no solution. Both companies are shirking their responsibilities, and now I\u2019m stuck with a defective laptop.This is unacceptable from two major companies that are supposed to be industry leaders. I will think twice before purchasing anything from Amazon or Dell again. Buyers beware! Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.;light weight, good portability, decent looks , good built quality, battery lasts 5-6 hrs for normal use , lasts 8 hrs on battery saver mode if you do light works .  All well except one  issue that is it starts lagging /stuttering, videos get hung if you use the laptop while charging due to overheating . But this problem is solved by using better cooling solution like using laptop bottom riser while charging. Dont forget to buy a laptop riser along with this product.",

For a price of ~600 this is an exceptional quality product. Since it's been years and I didn't take care of keyboard to avoid dust getting into it, the keys have become quite hard to press even after cleaning. This issue wouldn't have occurred if dust was avoided using a keyboard cover. Buying it again.;Product is as described in details.I bought to use with my laptop. working fine.travel distance is good, I could just switch from my laptop keyboard to this instantly.when I bought, some reviews said that keys are soft(true but), keys are harder than laptop keyboard and may create pain in hands in long term usage(gave me pain in 15-20 minutes of usage, may be because of lack of palm rest), anyways it feels good to type on this thing.- for a laptop setup this is recommended if you dont have more budget (if you have budget then go for some red keys mechanical keyboard)- for a desktop setup this is best in budget. (I think so...)-;Works well;Keys are smooth , adequate size;Great keyboard but not for gaming. It's travel distance is less so faster for typing but less enjoyful for pure gaming.;great thing.typing with this chiclet keyboard is great.;This keyboard has really good typing dynamics. It is very quiet with no rattling or clicking. The key movement is good and stable. It has just enough resistance to not feel sloppy or get accidental key-presses, while being light enough to really enable fast typing and high-productivity. The design also makes it easy to clean. ***NOTE: Dell makes a palm-rest that snaps into the base to form an integrated pair. This palm-rest makes the keyboard about perfect. The only downside is that I couldn't find the palm-rest on Amazon and had to buy it direct from Dell for an additional $21 (shipping included).;Love everything about this keyboard.

                "text": "I recently purchased the Dell 15 Thin & Light Laptop, and so far, I'm quite impressed. It packs a Core i5-1235U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, which makes multitasking smooth and quick. The 15.6\" FHD display is sharp and offers great visuals whether I'm streaming videos or working on documents.What stands out for me is how lightweight it is\u2014just 1.66kg\u2014making it super portable without feeling flimsy. Despite its slim design, the laptop feels sturdy, and the spill-resistant keyboard is a nice touch for added peace of mind.Another bonus is the pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office 2021, so I was ready to work right out of the box. The inclusion of 15 months of McAfee security is a nice plus, especially if you're cautious about online threats.If I had to nitpick, 8GB of RAM is decent for everyday tasks but may not be enough for more intensive work or gaming. Also, the build, while durable, does attract fingerprints, especially on the black finish.Overall, this is an excellent laptop for students, professionals, or anyone needing a reliable machine for daily use without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for its performance, portability, and value!;As soon as the 1year warranty period is over the laptop stopped working. It gets hanged or dropped out when I'm in a meeting. Also it gets hanged when I'm trying to open an excell or any file. I've been trying to reach the customer support as well but they don't take you call or respond to message. Worst customer service and worst product. Please don't buy it.;;Worth buying this, thx.;Fear that...it may blast;nice;I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare. Right out of the box, there was a glaring green dot on the screen that refuses to go away, and the camera is unstable, making it impossible to use for work or meetings.I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to help. When I contacted Dell, their so-called \"support\" team told me they could only replace the LED/ED screen and couldn\u2019t even provide me with a DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter. How does that even make sense for a brand-new product?I trusted Amazon and Dell to deliver a quality product and back it up with proper service, but I\u2019ve been left stuck in the middle with no solution. Both companies are shirking their responsibilities, and now I\u2019m stuck with a defective laptop.This is unacceptable from two major companies that are supposed to be industry leaders. I will think twice before purchasing anything from Amazon or Dell again. Buyers beware! Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.;light weight, good portability, decent looks , good built quality, battery lasts 5-6 hrs for normal use , lasts 8 hrs on battery saver mode if you do light works .  All well except one  issue that is it starts lagging /stuttering, videos get hung if you use the laptop while charging due to overheating . But this problem is solved by using better cooling solution like using laptop bottom riser while charging. Dont forget to buy a laptop riser along with this product.",

Dell Peripheral Manager won't recognize this device.;Keyboard Meets Expectation, very comfortable to use need 2 AAA battery,Mouse is bit delicate and battery place seems to be bit deeper, some times little difficult to pull out the battery, Overall very satisfied with the product.;Keyboard was good but the mouse light was not blinking but mouse is working;Really worth for the price paid. Compact and handy wireless feature for both key board and mouse comes with single dingle so its makes of one USB port instead of two one for key board and one for mouse;This product did not impress me what I expected. It could have been better if it comes with rechargeable batteries.Pros:1. The Keyboard design is very sleek and nice to see and smooth to type2. Mouse is good in design and resembles old model, simple and handyCons:1. The Keyboard is missing LED lights on CAPSLOCK, NUMLOCK, SCROLLLOCK indicators2. The Keyboard is missing ON/OFF button, so not sure how to stop consuming batteries3. The Mouse is missing DPI adjustment button, means it has fixed DPI settings and very slow pointer movement by default. This requires us to adjust pointer speed in computer.4. Very importantly Mouse is missing slot to keep USB Bluetooth adapter, There is high chances of losing it when not in use5. Mouse clicks makes noise which is not good for continuous users",

                "text": "The brand is enoughNice qualityGood connectivityLonger operational durationNice feel and handful.Easy to handle.Cheaper price.Recommended.;I recently purchased the Dell Mouse for the third time, and while it still maintains its reputation for a solid and reliable performance, there have been some unexpected changes that I feel compelled to address.In my previous encounters with this mouse, the distinctive red light used to be a notable feature, adding a touch of elegance and uniqueness to its appearance. However, this time around, it appears that Dell has disabled the red light, purportedly in the pursuit of enhancing battery efficiency. While I can appreciate the desire for longer battery life, I couldn't help but miss the visual appeal that the red light brought to the table.Upon receiving the product, I was initially concerned to find that the sensor light was not functioning. However, much to my relief, the mouse itself was fully functional and performed seamlessly, even in the absence of the red light. This is a testament to the mouse's core capabilities and engineering, as it managed to operate flawlessly despite this minor setback.Pros:1. Reliable performance: The mouse continues to function flawlessly, delivering precise cursor movements and smooth clicking.2. Battery efficiency: The decision to disable the red light in favor of improved battery life is a sensible one for users who prioritize extended usage between charges.3. Ergonomic design: The mouse's ergonomic shape and comfortable grip ensure long hours of usage without discomfort.Cons:1. Disabled red light: The omission of the red light, while understandable from a battery efficiency standpoint, takes away from the mouse's visual appeal.2. Non-functional sensor light: The absence of a functioning sensor light upon receipt can be initially concerning, even though the mouse operates as expected.In conclusion, the Dell Mouse retains its status as a reliable and dependable peripheral, living up to its reputation for seamless performance. The decision to disable the red light in favor of enhanced battery efficiency might divide opinions, with some appreciating the extended usage time and others missing the distinct aesthetic it brought. The non-functional sensor light upon receipt is a minor hiccup, overshadowed by the mouse's overall functionality. For those seeking a dependable and straightforward mouse experience, this Dell Mouse remains a solid choice.;I've been using this mouse for close to 2 years now. This mouse has worked exceptionally well. It's indeed value for money. For this price range, the mouse worked so well. I've never experienced any issues or lag with the mouse.

I have ordered this on Dec 11th with COD option. i have received the product which is not working. I tried to replace the item but from amazon no is response.;First of all. The build quality and rest of the features are great. But it's side scroll and extra button features are made ONLY FOR PEOPLE TO USE IN MICROSOFT APPLICATIONS, NOTHING ELSE. If you are that person, go for it. But if you like to get the most of a device I'd suggest you go for Logitech MX master. It's fractionally higher priced than this one and is loaded with features. With the features this one has its not worth half it's price.;The Dell WM118 Wireless Mouse is a solid choice for anyone in need of a reliable and efficient peripheral. With 1000 DPI optical tracking, it offers smooth and accurate cursor control, making it great for everyday tasks. The 2.4 GHz wireless connection ensures a stable link to your computer, and the USB nano receiver is small and unobtrusive.One of the best features is its impressive 12-month battery life, which means you can use it without constantly worrying about recharging or replacing the battery. The mouse is also comfortable to use, with a simple, ergonomic design that fits well in hand.Overall, the Dell WM118 is a dependable wireless mouse that delivers excellent performance at an affordable price. Highly recommended!;Good design, good functionlity, good scrolling speed,Noiseless scrolling,  but the mouse is noisy when we click everytime.;I am happy with my purchase. the only concern is the light that appeared when the mouse was turned on. The light is missing, which does not allow to know whether the mouse is on or off.

                "text": "Thank you Recyclekart & Amazon for delivering the Dell refurbished CPU which works well so far.Few things to be noted.Initial observation, the packaging was not that strong to hold the CPU intact in the transit. I received the product with the package torn here and there which worried me about the CPU damage altogether.When unpacked the box, I found mouse was missing. Cabinet was slightly damaged (could ignore as it is a refurbished product).No graphics card was installed.No inbuilt bluetooth/bluetooth adaptor which could have been better had provided.Though there was a DVD writer it was not functioning.The other specs in terms of RAM, HDD, SSD size, processor etc., was available as disclosed.When the system was ready to start functioning, noticed hanging issues. The issue was with the RAM. I had to remove the faulty 8GB RAM to get rid of the hanging issues. Finally, the system works fine with only 8GB RAM though the CPU comes with 16 GB RAM. I ordered the CPU on August 9. I got the product on August 19. I am using the system since then with no issues.The warranty registration process was swift. The technician was patient to handle my queries for the registration process. On the faulty 8GB RAM, the seller/technician promised to supply me with the good one once I return the faulty one.Please take note of the above points highlighted.Thank you for giving a good product. Overall a good refurbished CPU which works smoothly with no issues for one's daily needs.Worthy buying Go for it!Thank you Recyclekart for the activation of my MS office 2021 on March 03, 2025.I appreciate the promptness and accuracy of the technical team at Recyclekart.Keep up the good job!Thank you!;Buy this product only if you\u2019re prepared to wait up to a month for service or returns\u2014or if you\u2019re looking to make a YouTube review about the experience. For the price, it offers excellent value with features like the operating system, MS Office, a 1TB hard drive, and SSD storage. However, the after-sales support leaves much to be desired.Previously, Amazon\u2019s no-questions-asked return policy made buying such products less risky. Unfortunately, that\u2019s no longer the case. It took me an entire month to return my device and get a refund. The assigned service engineer never showed up. When they finally contacted me, they only requested an OTP, claiming it would make the return eligible. Thankfully, Amazon stepped in to resolve the issue and processed the return.Tips for buyers:\u2022 Record a video of the unboxing on the day the product arrives.\u2022 If there\u2019s an issue, immediately raise a case with Amazon and request a service engineer within two days.\u2022 Do not attempt to fix the device yourself, as this could void the warranty or affect your return eligibility.\u2022 If the engineer doesn\u2019t respond promptly, contact Amazon and request a refund without delay.;Working good...;My old Dell was probably 15 years old and SO SLOW. We don't use our computer that much so we really didn't want to spend a lot of money on a new one. This deal was awesome. Monitor and keyboard also included. My SIL came over to hook everything up. We had no issues. (the button on the monitor is a little bit squirrely but works). It seems to be super fast and running good so far.;Within 3 months the system stopped working (not switching on) and there is no way to avail the warranty. We actually bought extended warranty on the product as well but since this product didnt even last the standard 6 months, it has been completely wasted. And the worst part, there is no way to contact the seller. Even the amazon customer service could not locate any way to contact the seller to avail the warranty.;Received CPU timely in good Packing, Performance is really good, working fine since purchase no problem at all;The product is fine with respect to the price given. Really worthit but as I am living in Bangalore and two weaks back my system stoped working, So since they dont have a service center here in Bangalore, I have send it to Delhi for replacement as it in in waranty. It cost me money and time also, due to which I got delayed to finish my work.My humble request to Recyclekart, please focus on providing service to your costumers.And for new buyers please check if there is a service center in your area before buying any product..;Got the refurbished Dell Optiplex on time. System was not working and when checked, noticed that the RAM is not installed. Reported this to Amazon and the executive offered that they will inspect on the issue and it will be sorted out shortly. Now, even after 2 weeks, nothing happened. Even though they says Return or Replacement possible, we cannot go for any return or replacement as the same is possible only thru amazon customer care. If they could have confirmed whether the missing part will be forwarded or not, we can proceed to buy the part or wait for delivery. So guys, beware of this point while ordering refurbished product from amazon",

                "text": "The media could not be loaded.As a first-time laptop user, the Dell 15 has exceeded my expectations with its excellent performance and versatile features. I primarily use this laptop for trading, watching movies, and general productivity tasks, and it has proven to be more than capable for all my needs.**Performance and Display:**Equipped with an Intel 12th Gen Core i3 processor and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop delivers smooth and responsive performance, even when multitasking between multiple applications. The 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a stunning visual experience, making movies come to life and enhancing the fluidity of my trading charts.**Portability and Build Quality:**Weighing just 1.69kg and featuring a thin and lightweight design, the Dell 15 is easy to carry around, whether I'm working from home or on the go. The spill-resistant keyboard adds a layer of durability, giving me peace of mind against accidental spills during long trading sessions or movie marathons.**Value for Money:**At a price of 29k, this laptop offers exceptional value for money. With its solid performance, vibrant display, and practical features, it competes favorably with higher-priced alternatives on the market. For a first-time laptop buyer like myself, it's reassuring to know that I've made a wise investment in a reliable and versatile computing device.**Future Updates:**I plan to update this review after six months of using the Dell 15, providing valuable insights into its long-term performance, durability, and any additional features or drawbacks I may discover over time. This will be helpful for others who are considering purchasing the same laptop and are looking for real-world experiences.**Final Thoughts:**Overall, the Dell 15 has been an outstanding first laptop for me. Its combination of performance, display quality, portability, and affordability makes it an ideal choice for users looking for a versatile companion for everyday computing tasks. Whether you're a student, professional, or casual user, the Dell 15 delivers a compelling user experience that punches above its price point. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for their first laptop or a reliable upgrade.Edit: today 7 September 2024 my hinges broked but because of dell service they replaced my hinges and laptop upper body \ud83d\udc45 , Hinges were hard and after replacement they're very smooth like Amul butter. Zero rupees replacement! Just call customer care and told everything! Within 2 days engineer visit and fixed it!, check my images and videos.Overall laptop is great \ud83d\ude38! I bought this laptop only 29k because of credit card discount..;I ordered this laptop and I had received old and used laptop in open box. Orignal box was open which was kept inside good amazon outer box, so I couldn't check open box while taking laptop delivery. See below issues that I faced and need your attention so that you save your money.Open box, used laptopI order 14\" laptop and received 15.9\" display.It was getting Heat too much in this cold winter weather.When pressed power switch thrice it turns on.Some times there is black screen and only cursor visible. Twice it happened.Faulty product, was looking like refurbished computer.This seller is selling faulty product. Be aware. It's good to buy from local shop.Configuration is same as described.There are 21% , 1star review;Over all good product, Battery exhaust fast.;The media could not be loaded.It Is Very Ideal For Work And Without Lagging. Very Handy To Use, Feels Like A Book & Is Light. Very Clear Display. Very Satisfied From Amazon. We Were Initially Worried About Quality But It Is The Best By Value.You Can Go For It For Office Working. Used For 4 Hours 100% to 15% In Full Use.;Received my system on 27th February, Completed system configuration, yet to start using.Positive - Received in company (Dell) packing, and Amazon box on top of it, lot of protection inside, brand new piece, verily slim look \u2026 Overall look and feel is Brilliant\u2026Shall write more about performance once I start using itThanks everyone for your attention;I purchased this laptop on the 18th and today is the 24th. I have read a lot of reviews complaining about heating issues and yes they are right. This laptop is a heater. It will be very helpful during the winter season.But I am keeping this as I have liked it and that's why the good 3 stars I am giving.When you use any laptop for the first few days, it heats up pretty badly because of a lot of updates going on in the background. I was almost scared when I see it heats up super bad and was thinking to return it. But that was just one time. But still, it heats up more than a normal laptop should. I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work. I just purchased it as a backup laptop because my main laptop Asus Vivobook runs 14 to 18hrs a day for the last 5 yrs and it needs some rest.Personally, I won't recommend this laptop. Maybe try Asus or HP. Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though. Will update after 4-5 months of usage and re-write proper review after 1 year of usageEdit: 21st August 2024.Well, on 14th August, 2024, laptop stopped working. I sent it to Dell repair and found motherboard is dead. They need to replace it whole.So I am not recommending this laptop. People say right. Never bought expensive stuffs online. This is 4th laptop and 1st online and so huge issue. Motherboard estimation is 16500 right now. Luckily I have insurance, I am not sure how much will they cover. My Asus, HP, Compaq and Macbook never got motherboard issue and all lasted long. This one gave so big issues even from start and now look at it.",

                "text": "The brand is enoughNice qualityGood connectivityLonger operational durationNice feel and handful.Easy to handle.Cheaper price.Recommended.;I recently purchased the Dell Mouse for the third time, and while it still maintains its reputation for a solid and reliable performance, there have been some unexpected changes that I feel compelled to address.In my previous encounters with this mouse, the distinctive red light used to be a notable feature, adding a touch of elegance and uniqueness to its appearance. However, this time around, it appears that Dell has disabled the red light, purportedly in the pursuit of enhancing battery efficiency. While I can appreciate the desire for longer battery life, I couldn't help but miss the visual appeal that the red light brought to the table.Upon receiving the product, I was initially concerned to find that the sensor light was not functioning. However, much to my relief, the mouse itself was fully functional and performed seamlessly, even in the absence of the red light. This is a testament to the mouse's core capabilities and engineering, as it managed to operate flawlessly despite this minor setback.Pros:1. Reliable performance: The mouse continues to function flawlessly, delivering precise cursor movements and smooth clicking.2. Battery efficiency: The decision to disable the red light in favor of improved battery life is a sensible one for users who prioritize extended usage between charges.3. Ergonomic design: The mouse's ergonomic shape and comfortable grip ensure long hours of usage without discomfort.Cons:1. Disabled red light: The omission of the red light, while understandable from a battery efficiency standpoint, takes away from the mouse's visual appeal.2. Non-functional sensor light: The absence of a functioning sensor light upon receipt can be initially concerning, even though the mouse operates as expected.In conclusion, the Dell Mouse retains its status as a reliable and dependable peripheral, living up to its reputation for seamless performance. The decision to disable the red light in favor of enhanced battery efficiency might divide opinions, with some appreciating the extended usage time and others missing the distinct aesthetic it brought. The non-functional sensor light upon receipt is a minor hiccup, overshadowed by the mouse's overall functionality. For those seeking a dependable and straightforward mouse experience, this Dell Mouse remains a solid choice.;I've been using this mouse for close to 2 years now. This mouse has worked exceptionally well. It's indeed value for money. For this price range, the mouse worked so well. I've never experienced any issues or lag with the mouse. It connects instantly with my Windows & Mac laptop. I'd definitely recommend this mouse to everyone who's looking for a wireless mouse in this range.;Worst roduct. I have ordered this on Dec 11th with COD option. i have received the product which is not working. I tried to replace the item but from amazon no is response.;First of all. The build quality and rest of the features are great. But it's side scroll and extra button features are made ONLY FOR PEOPLE TO USE IN MICROSOFT APPLICATIONS, NOTHING ELSE. If you are that person, go for it. But if you like to get the most of a device I'd suggest you go for Logitech MX master. It's fractionally higher priced than this one and is loaded with features. With the features this one has its not worth half it's price.;The Dell WM118 Wireless Mouse is a solid choice for anyone in need of a reliable and efficient peripheral. With 1000 DPI optical tracking, it offers smooth and accurate cursor control, making it great for everyday tasks. The 2.4 GHz wireless connection ensures a stable link to your computer, and the USB nano receiver is small and unobtrusive.One of the best features is its impressive 12-month battery life, which means you can use it without constantly worrying about recharging or replacing the battery. The mouse is also comfortable to use, with a simple, ergonomic design that fits well in hand.Overall, the Dell WM118 is a dependable wireless mouse that delivers excellent performance at an affordable price. Highly recommended!;Good design, good functionlity, good scrolling speed,Noiseless scrolling,  but the mouse is noisy when we click everytime.;I am happy with my purchase. the only concern is the light that appeared when the mouse was turned on. The light is missing, which does not allow to know whether the mouse is on or off. Overall it is handy, light weight and very much usable on all surfaces.;Sem problemas, funcionando perfeitamente;Nice travel mouse, doesn't take too much space. Good size if your mobile all the time.;Entrega r\u00e1pida y oportuna me lleg\u00f3 mi factura;Works well with my Dell laptop. Sensitive and accurate. Comfortable.;La qualit\u00e9 Dell",

Metal logo was missing and model number print was not there and no DVD drive but in picture it is shown. Just written DELL on plastic itself, so it's generic box as described in details which not many read and understand.Performance of the box is very nice updated drivers using DELL software assistant which recognises the device as geniune with service tag number but service warrenty expired in 2019 as DELL have stopped supporting this model I guess.Wifi dongle which they sent is not much of use, buy good external usb wifi dongle with antenna for good internet experience.Audio quality is good and loud when used headphones.Picture is crisp still lot of space inside box to fit low end graphics card and 4 RAM slots avilable which you can update with 16gb each to have total 64gb as per sepc on DELL website.M.2 slot avilable for NVME drive if you want to.SK Hynix RAM 2133Mhz 8gb installed inside. 256 gb SSD exist and Win 11 and office 2019 1 year trail.Fan makes hardly any sound at all.With  card discout got it for 7.6k.I hope they will rectify all details which are missmatch and creating confusion like form factor not mentioned as SFF and dimensions don't match and add exact photo don't give impression that you will get DVD drive also.Overall nice system for every day use. I am thinking to format and use some other OS after 6 months as I have another Win11 system already.;woderfull sysytem kam kar raqhi hain;Valu for money;Value of money device, good quality but processor is different and slow speed.",

                "text": "I recently purchased the Dell 15 Thin & Light Laptop, and so far, I'm quite impressed. It packs a Core i5-1235U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, which makes multitasking smooth and quick. The 15.6\" FHD display is sharp and offers great visuals whether I'm streaming videos or working on documents.What stands out for me is how lightweight it is\u2014just 1.66kg\u2014making it super portable without feeling flimsy. Despite its slim design, the laptop feels sturdy, and the spill-resistant keyboard is a nice touch for added peace of mind.Another bonus is the pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office 2021, so I was ready to work right out of the box. The inclusion of 15 months of McAfee security is a nice plus, especially if you're cautious about online threats.If I had to nitpick, 8GB of RAM is decent for everyday tasks but may not be enough for more intensive work or gaming. Also, the build, while durable, does attract fingerprints, especially on the black finish.Overall, this is an excellent laptop for students, professionals, or anyone needing a reliable machine for daily use without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for its performance, portability, and value!;As soon as the 1year warranty period is over the laptop stopped working. It gets hanged or dropped out when I'm in a meeting. Also it gets hanged when I'm trying to open an excell or any file. I've been trying to reach the customer support as well but they don't take you call or respond to message. Worst customer service and worst product. Please don't buy it.;;Worth buying this, thx.;Fear that...it may blast;nice;I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare. Right out of the box, there was a glaring green dot on the screen that refuses to go away, and the camera is unstable, making it impossible to use for work or meetings.I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to help. When I contacted Dell, their so-called \"support\" team told me they could only replace the LED/ED screen and couldn\u2019t even provide me with a DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter. How does that even make sense for a brand-new product?I trusted Amazon and Dell to deliver a quality product and back it up with proper service, but I\u2019ve been left stuck in the middle with no solution. Both companies are shirking their responsibilities, and now I\u2019m stuck with a defective laptop.This is unacceptable from two major companies that are supposed to be industry leaders. I will think twice before purchasing anything from Amazon or Dell again. Buyers beware! Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.;light weight, good portability, decent looks , good built quality, battery lasts 5-6 hrs for normal use , lasts 8 hrs on battery saver mode if you do light works .  All well except one  issue that is it starts lagging /stuttering, videos get hung if you use the laptop while charging due to overheating . But this problem is solved by using better cooling solution like using laptop bottom riser while charging. Dont forget to buy a laptop riser along with this product.",

Simply could have delivered the missing Dell Active Pen or replaced the product and delivered all the times again.Not satisfied and very disappointed.;but sometimes stop working;Great Product with the price point , 2in1 laptop with the excellent touch sensor , great brand Compact, Iris display, touch screen, performance and good speed. So all are amazing. Value for the money compare to other brand. Nice product from Dell. Also as a go green initiative it is designed with sustainable materials and ships in packaging made from 100% recycled and renewable materials and is 100% recyclable;Touch screen is not functioning. We made request to repair to the company. But not yet done till today. At the same time, Amazon service is so poor in our area, south Mizoram.;Received damaged item;You'll be left with only 150gb of storage to use in a 256gb of total storage...pls be aware of it before buy.And, few models comes with pen few are not, pls choose correct model if u want pen. I did a mistake in both the above aspects in this buy.Most importantly, RAM is onboard which means there is no additional port to expand RAM in future. This was a major let down for me.HDMI is just 1.4 not 2 ir 2.1.Good thing is Ram is DDR5(means faster) which is rare to find in this segment.Backlight keyboard is really nice and it is 2 level adjustable which I really liked.Touch sensitivity and response is great.Fingerprint works fine, kids like it a lot.Speakers are front firing which is good.;The screen stopped working in less than a months time.

Its sleek black design fits well in professional settings, and the 8 GB RAM ensures smooth performance. A great option for those seeking reliable, efficient computing without the hefty price tag of new models.;I had bought dell CPU 6 months ago and just after delivery within a week it become defective and being replaced and it\u2019s SMPS was two times replaced during this time period. They took 2 months to replace SMPS and when we asked for its repair they are denying to do so as it is out of warranty. Means this is insane that your company is taking 2 months to replace SMPS and than you are not even solving the issues.This is not at all acceptable from such a trusted online site . So think twice while buying products from Amazon . It\u2019s better to buy from local vendors to save your time as well as money because mine both are wasted from last 6 months .Highly disappointed!!!!;I purchase dell refurbished CPU and till now it's working very good uploaded with office 10 no any scratch its look like new.

I primarily use this laptop for trading, watching movies, and general productivity tasks, and it has proven to be more than capable for all my needs.**Performance and Display:**Equipped with an Intel 12th Gen Core i3 processor and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop delivers smooth and responsive performance, even when multitasking between multiple applications. The 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a stunning visual experience, making movies come to life and enhancing the fluidity of my trading charts.**Portability and Build Quality:**Weighing just 1.69kg and featuring a thin and lightweight design, the Dell 15 is easy to carry around, whether I'm working from home or on the go. The spill-resistant keyboard adds a layer of durability, giving me peace of mind against accidental spills during long trading sessions or movie marathons.**Value for Money:**At a price of 29k, this laptop offers exceptional value for money. With its solid performance, vibrant display, and practical features, it competes favorably with higher-priced alternatives on the market. For a first-time laptop buyer like myself, it's reassuring to know that I've made a wise investment in a reliable and versatile computing device.**Future Updates:**I plan to update this review after six months of using the Dell 15, providing valuable insights into its long-term performance, durability, and any additional features or drawbacks I may discover over time. This will be helpful for others who are considering purchasing the same laptop and are looking for real-world experiences.**Final Thoughts:**Overall, the Dell 15 has been an outstanding first laptop for me. Its combination of performance, display quality, portability, and affordability makes it an ideal choice for users looking for a versatile companion for everyday computing tasks. Whether you're a student, professional, or casual user, the Dell 15 delivers a compelling user experience that punches above its price point. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for their first laptop or a reliable upgrade.Edit: today 7 September 2024 my hinges broked but because of dell service they replaced my hinges and laptop upper body \ud83d\udc45 , Hinges were hard and after replacement they're very smooth like Amul butter. Zero rupees replacement! Just call customer care and told everything! Within 2 days engineer visit and fixed it!, check my images and videos.Overall laptop is great \ud83d\ude38! I bought this laptop only 29k because of credit card discount..;I ordered this laptop and I had received old and used laptop in open box. Orignal box was open which was kept inside good amazon outer box, so I couldn't check open box while taking laptop delivery. See below issues that I faced and need your attention so that you save your money.Open box, used laptopI order 14\" laptop and received 15.9\" display.It was getting Heat too much in this cold winter weather.When pressed power switch thrice it turns on.Some times there is black screen and only cursor visible. Twice it happened.Faulty product, was looking like refurbished computer.This seller is selling faulty product. Be aware. It's good to buy from local shop.Configuration is same as described.There are 21% , 1star review;Over all good product, Battery exhaust fast.;The media could not be loaded.It Is Very Ideal For Work And Without Lagging. Very Handy To Use, Feels Like A Book & Is Light. Very Clear Display. Very Satisfied From Amazon. We Were Initially Worried About Quality But It Is The Best By Value.You Can Go For It For Office Working. Used For 4 Hours 100% to 15% In Full Use.;Received my system on 27th February, Completed system configuration, yet to start using.Positive - Received in company (Dell) packing, and Amazon box on top of it, lot of protection inside, brand new piece, verily slim look \u2026 Overall look and feel is Brilliant\u2026Shall write more about performance once I start using itThanks everyone for your attention;I purchased this laptop on the 18th and today is the 24th. I have read a lot of reviews complaining about heating issues and yes they are right. This laptop is a heater. It will be very helpful during the winter season.But I am keeping this as I have liked it and that's why the good 3 stars I am giving.When you use any laptop for the first few days, it heats up pretty badly because of a lot of updates going on in the background. I was almost scared when I see it heats up super bad and was thinking to return it. But that was just one time. But still, it heats up more than a normal laptop should. I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work. I just purchased it as a backup laptop because my main laptop Asus Vivobook runs 14 to 18hrs a day for the last 5 yrs and it needs some rest.Personally, I won't recommend this laptop. Maybe try Asus or HP. Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though. Will update after 4-5 months of usage and re-write proper review after 1 year of usageEdit: 21st August 2024.Well, on 14th August, 2024, laptop stopped working. I sent it to Dell repair and found motherboard is dead. They need to replace it whole.So I am not recommending this laptop. People say right. Never bought expensive stuffs online. This is 4th laptop and 1st online and so huge issue. Motherboard estimation is 16500 right now. Luckily I have insurance, I am not sure how much will they cover. My Asus, HP, Compaq and Macbook never got motherboard issue and all lasted long. This one gave so big issues even from start and now look at it.",

                "text": "I recently purchased the Dell 15 Thin & Light Laptop, and so far, I'm quite impressed. It packs a Core i5-1235U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, which makes multitasking smooth and quick. The 15.6\" FHD display is sharp and offers great visuals whether I'm streaming videos or working on documents.What stands out for me is how lightweight it is\u2014just 1.66kg\u2014making it super portable without feeling flimsy. Despite its slim design, the laptop feels sturdy, and the spill-resistant keyboard is a nice touch for added peace of mind.Another bonus is the pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office 2021, so I was ready to work right out of the box. The inclusion of 15 months of McAfee security is a nice plus, especially if you're cautious about online threats.If I had to nitpick, 8GB of RAM is decent for everyday tasks but may not be enough for more intensive work or gaming. Also, the build, while durable, does attract fingerprints, especially on the black finish.Overall, this is an excellent laptop for students, professionals, or anyone needing a reliable machine for daily use without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for its performance, portability, and value!;As soon as the 1year warranty period is over the laptop stopped working. It gets hanged or dropped out when I'm in a meeting. Also it gets hanged when I'm trying to open an excell or any file. I've been trying to reach the customer support as well but they don't take you call or respond to message. Worst customer service and worst product. Please don't buy it.;;Worth buying this, thx.;Fear that...it may blast;nice;I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare. Right out of the box, there was a glaring green dot on the screen that refuses to go away, and the camera is unstable, making it impossible to use for work or meetings.I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to help. When I contacted Dell, their so-called \"support\" team told me they could only replace the LED/ED screen and couldn\u2019t even provide me with a DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter. How does that even make sense for a brand-new product?I trusted Amazon and Dell to deliver a quality product and back it up with proper service, but I\u2019ve been left stuck in the middle with no solution. Both companies are shirking their responsibilities, and now I\u2019m stuck with a defective laptop.This is unacceptable from two major companies that are supposed to be industry leaders. I will think twice before purchasing anything from Amazon or Dell again. Buyers beware! Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.;light weight, good portability, decent looks , good built quality, battery lasts 5-6 hrs for normal use , lasts 8 hrs on battery saver mode if you do light works .  All well except one  issue that is it starts lagging /stuttering, videos get hung if you use the laptop while charging due to overheating . But this problem is solved by using better cooling solution like using laptop bottom riser while charging. Dont forget to buy a laptop riser along with this product.",

                "text": "The brand is enoughNice qualityGood connectivityLonger operational durationNice feel and handful.Easy to handle.Cheaper price.Recommended.;I recently purchased the Dell Mouse for the third time, and while it still maintains its reputation for a solid and reliable performance, there have been some unexpected changes that I feel compelled to address.In my previous encounters with this mouse, the distinctive red light used to be a notable feature, adding a touch of elegance and uniqueness to its appearance. However, this time around, it appears that Dell has disabled the red light, purportedly in the pursuit of enhancing battery efficiency. While I can appreciate the desire for longer battery life, I couldn't help but miss the visual appeal that the red light brought to the table.Upon receiving the product, I was initially concerned to find that the sensor light was not functioning. However, much to my relief, the mouse itself was fully functional and performed seamlessly, even in the absence of the red light. This is a testament to the mouse's core capabilities and engineering, as it managed to operate flawlessly despite this minor setback.Pros:1. Reliable performance: The mouse continues to function flawlessly, delivering precise cursor movements and smooth clicking.2. Battery efficiency: The decision to disable the red light in favor of improved battery life is a sensible one for users who prioritize extended usage between charges.3. Ergonomic design: The mouse's ergonomic shape and comfortable grip ensure long hours of usage without discomfort.Cons:1. Disabled red light: The omission of the red light, while understandable from a battery efficiency standpoint, takes away from the mouse's visual appeal.2. Non-functional sensor light: The absence of a functioning sensor light upon receipt can be initially concerning, even though the mouse operates as expected.In conclusion, the Dell Mouse retains its status as a reliable and dependable peripheral, living up to its reputation for seamless performance. The decision to disable the red light in favor of enhanced battery efficiency might divide opinions, with some appreciating the extended usage time and others missing the distinct aesthetic it brought. The non-functional sensor light upon receipt is a minor hiccup, overshadowed by the mouse's overall functionality. For those seeking a dependable and straightforward mouse experience, this Dell Mouse remains a solid choice.;I've been using this mouse for close to 2 years now. This mouse has worked exceptionally well. It's indeed value for money. For this price range, the mouse worked so well. I've never experienced any issues or lag with the mouse. It connects instantly with my Windows & Mac laptop. I'd definitely recommend this mouse to everyone who's looking for a wireless mouse in this range.;Worst roduct. I have ordered this on Dec 11th with COD option. i have received the product which is not working. I tried to replace the item but from amazon no is response.;First of all. The build quality and rest of the features are great. But it's side scroll and extra button features are made ONLY FOR PEOPLE TO USE IN MICROSOFT APPLICATIONS, NOTHING ELSE. If you are that person, go for it. But if you like to get the most of a device I'd suggest you go for Logitech MX master. It's fractionally higher priced than this one and is loaded with features. With the features this one has its not worth half it's price.;The Dell WM118 Wireless Mouse is a solid choice for anyone in need of a reliable and efficient peripheral. With 1000 DPI optical tracking, it offers smooth and accurate cursor control, making it great for everyday tasks. The 2.4 GHz wireless connection ensures a stable link to your computer, and the USB nano receiver is small and unobtrusive.One of the best features is its impressive 12-month battery life, which means you can use it without constantly worrying about recharging or replacing the battery. The mouse is also comfortable to use, with a simple, ergonomic design that fits well in hand.Overall, the Dell WM118 is a dependable wireless mouse that delivers excellent performance at an affordable price. Highly recommended!;Good design, good functionlity, good scrolling speed,Noiseless scrolling,  but the mouse is noisy when we click everytime.;I am happy with my purchase. the only concern is the light that appeared when the mouse was turned on. The light is missing, which does not allow to know whether the mouse is on or off. Overall it is handy, light weight and very much usable on all surfaces.;Sem problemas, funcionando perfeitamente;Nice travel mouse, doesn't take too much space. Good size if your mobile all the time.;Entrega r\u00e1pida y oportuna me lleg\u00f3 mi factura;Works well with my Dell laptop. Sensitive and accurate. Comfortable.;La qualit\u00e9 Dell",

Display is good and the build quality is decent. Height adjustable as well. The USB hub works like a charm if you ensure the upstream cable is connected. Type C is downstream alone, so cannot be used for display but can be used for data transfer and charging. For USB C display suggest to go for U2424HE which has better display and USB C hub option. But for those looking for a budget USB type A hub monitor, P2425H is really good. HDMI cable is not provided in the box which is disappointing.;This monitor is excellent and the matte finish glass gives a feeling of premium monitor. I got it at 13K on amazon as the seller was offering a 1500/- discount.The only minor issue is that the button to adjust the brightness and other settings is behind the monitor which is not best position to place the buttons. However, that is not a deal breaker as those are just one time settings for me. I am mainly using it for coding.;Nice Monitor with Quality performance & smart look,  Flexible enough, value for money as this model is worth it. Thankyou Seller & services overall appreciated.;It\u2019s a good monitor for office productivity, coding or where we have to deal with more text. Rotation of monitor from almost all the possible angles makes things easy to work, also the ports this monitor provides USB type C and A is a great deal. The only thing to consider here, this is shipped with Display port cable not HDMI cable, so you might have to purchase a HDMI cable in case your device don\u2019t have display port.;Not recommended, very bad product;I bought it in 2022 march. It's worth the price and quality is also great. Still using it without a complaint;Not satisfied with the wiring. Very loose, gets disconnected frequently.;Recomendo, a DELL tem os melhores monitores girat\u00f3rios.

G\u00f6r\u00fcnt\u00fcs\u00fc \u00e7ok iyi.;Ich habe vor einigen Monaten den Dell Gaming Monitor (Modell G2422HS) gekauft und bin absolut begeistert! Die Bildqualit\u00e4t ist einfach fantastisch \u2013 die Farben sind lebendig und die Schwarzwerte sind tief, was das Gaming-Erlebnis wirklich verbessert.Die hohe Hz-Zahl sorgt daf\u00fcr, dass es keine Geisterbilder oder Verz\u00f6gerungen gibt, selbst in den schnellsten Spielen. Ich spiele viel FPS und MOBA, und ich habe sofort einen Unterschied bemerkt. Die Bildwiederholfrequenz von 165 Hz macht das Gameplay super fl\u00fcssig und reaktionsschnell. Auch das IPS Panel kann ich nur empfehlen. Im Vergleich zu meinem alten TN-Panel ist es wirklich ein Unterschied. Vor allem in dunklen Bildern.Ein weiteres Highlight ist das ergonomische Design. Der Monitor l\u00e4sst sich leicht in der H\u00f6he verstellen und neigen, was f\u00fcr lange Gaming-Sessions sehr angenehm ist.Zusammenfassend kann ich diesen Dell Gaming Monitor jedem empfehlen, der auf der Suche nach einem hochwertigen Bildschirm f\u00fcr Gaming ist. Er bietet ein hervorragendes Preis-Leistungs-Verh\u00e4ltnis und hat meine Erwartungen \u00fcbertroffen!",

Having such a powerful processor and graphics card the weight of laptop is really nice . I played Gta 5 for around 1 2 hours in this case the laptop doesn't heat to much and also fan noise are not to loud. Lenevo really making this series looks like legion . Appreciate it lenevo.;Does everything you expect of it. Very sturdy and smooth.Battery life is slightly disappointing though, lasts 3-4 hours of using things like Word and PowerPoint as well, which is not ideal, but considering the hardware, somewhat expected. To be fair Lenovo has mentioned that on a packaging film beforehand itself.Does not have pre-installed activated MS Office, has to be bought separately (the Lenovo website version says that it has it).Otherwise pretty good.;The laptop is as good as I thought. No issues, no problem. I am an occasional gamer, so for me, it's good. And video editing is smooth.I don't know why people complaint about sound, the sound is satisfactory.The display is top notch and battery life is also good (approx 4 hrs on 100% charge). Makes no noise. Built quality is royal.Loved it.;It is a mid range laptop ,sound quality is superb, but its comes with low volume .Display:It comes with 300nits .Its excellent experience gives to user.Keyboard keys: very good key travel is superb,respond time also good.Track pad: very smooth response is good.Web cam :it is comes with 720p quality.Overall rating : I give 4out of 5 .",

                "text": "I recently purchased the Dell 15 Thin & Light Laptop, and so far, I'm quite impressed. It packs a Core i5-1235U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, which makes multitasking smooth and quick. The 15.6\" FHD display is sharp and offers great visuals whether I'm streaming videos or working on documents.What stands out for me is how lightweight it is\u2014just 1.66kg\u2014making it super portable without feeling flimsy. Despite its slim design, the laptop feels sturdy, and the spill-resistant keyboard is a nice touch for added peace of mind.Another bonus is the pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office 2021, so I was ready to work right out of the box. The inclusion of 15 months of McAfee security is a nice plus, especially if you're cautious about online threats.If I had to nitpick, 8GB of RAM is decent for everyday tasks but may not be enough for more intensive work or gaming. Also, the build, while durable, does attract fingerprints, especially on the black finish.Overall, this is an excellent laptop for students, professionals, or anyone needing a reliable machine for daily use without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for its performance, portability, and value!;As soon as the 1year warranty period is over the laptop stopped working. It gets hanged or dropped out when I'm in a meeting. Also it gets hanged when I'm trying to open an excell or any file. I've been trying to reach the customer support as well but they don't take you call or respond to message. Worst customer service and worst product. Please don't buy it.;;Worth buying this, thx.;Fear that...it may blast;nice;I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare. Right out of the box, there was a glaring green dot on the screen that refuses to go away, and the camera is unstable, making it impossible to use for work or meetings.I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to help. When I contacted Dell, their so-called \"support\" team told me they could only replace the LED/ED screen and couldn\u2019t even provide me with a DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter. How does that even make sense for a brand-new product?I trusted Amazon and Dell to deliver a quality product and back it up with proper service, but I\u2019ve been left stuck in the middle with no solution. Both companies are shirking their responsibilities, and now I\u2019m stuck with a defective laptop.This is unacceptable from two major companies that are supposed to be industry leaders. I will think twice before purchasing anything from Amazon or Dell again. Buyers beware! Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.;light weight, good portability, decent looks , good built quality, battery lasts 5-6 hrs for normal use , lasts 8 hrs on battery saver mode if you do light works .  All well except one  issue that is it starts lagging /stuttering, videos get hung if you use the laptop while charging due to overheating . But this problem is solved by using better cooling solution like using laptop bottom riser while charging. Dont forget to buy a laptop riser along with this product.",

Dissapointed with the screen brightness which is not that high in well lit and outdoor places . Also the screen does not support 4 K videos which is a bit of a letdown if you are spending around 100 k for a laptop.Overall one can opt for this laptop , however if you get better features in this price range in any other laptop , better to go for that.;heating so fast when I started the laptop It started heating within 3 min and the battery drained within 2 hours .1. The lack of worth is too much for it.;BEST touchscreen and compact laptop verynice and durable in any condition mast laptop.

USB and Audio jacks are way too away making it uncomfortable if u have short wires for earpiece and USB devices such as mouse, keyboard, etc do not understand who in dell is experimenting with the architecture of dell devices. Dell laptops used to be sturdier and these days dell has weak body than hp. Charger provided is not from dell and is very substandard and cheap, not sure about longevity of charger cable. Dell used to provide its own brand charger but now no original charger, doubt that seller kept the original and supplied the fake one.

Display is good and the build quality is decent. Height adjustable as well. The USB hub works like a charm if you ensure the upstream cable is connected. Type C is downstream alone, so cannot be used for display but can be used for data transfer and charging. For USB C display suggest to go for U2424HE which has better display and USB C hub option. But for those looking for a budget USB type A hub monitor, P2425H is really good. HDMI cable is not provided in the box which is disappointing.;This monitor is excellent and the matte finish glass gives a feeling of premium monitor. I got it at 13K on amazon as the seller was offering a 1500/- discount.The only minor issue is that the button to adjust the brightness and other settings is behind the monitor which is not best position to place the buttons. However, that is not a deal breaker as those are just one time settings for me. I am mainly using it for coding.;Nice Monitor with Quality performance & smart look,  Flexible enough, value for money as this model is worth it. Thankyou Seller & services overall appreciated.;It\u2019s a good monitor for office productivity, coding or where we have to deal with more text. Rotation of monitor from almost all the possible angles makes things easy to work, also the ports this monitor provides USB type C and A is a great deal. The only thing to consider here, this is shipped with Display port cable not HDMI cable, so you might have to purchase a HDMI cable in case your device don\u2019t have display port.;Not recommended, very bad product;I bought it in 2022 march. It's worth the price and quality is also great. Still using it without a complaint;Not satisfied with the wiring. Very loose, gets disconnected frequently.;Recomendo, a DELL tem os melhores monitores girat\u00f3rios.

Die Bildqualit\u00e4t ist einfach fantastisch \u2013 die Farben sind lebendig und die Schwarzwerte sind tief, was das Gaming-Erlebnis wirklich verbessert.Die hohe Hz-Zahl sorgt daf\u00fcr, dass es keine Geisterbilder oder Verz\u00f6gerungen gibt, selbst in den schnellsten Spielen. Ich spiele viel FPS und MOBA, und ich habe sofort einen Unterschied bemerkt. Die Bildwiederholfrequenz von 165 Hz macht das Gameplay super fl\u00fcssig und reaktionsschnell. Auch das IPS Panel kann ich nur empfehlen. Im Vergleich zu meinem alten TN-Panel ist es wirklich ein Unterschied. Vor allem in dunklen Bildern.Ein weiteres Highlight ist das ergonomische Design. Der Monitor l\u00e4sst sich leicht in der H\u00f6he verstellen und neigen, was f\u00fcr lange Gaming-Sessions sehr angenehm ist.Zusammenfassend kann ich diesen Dell Gaming Monitor jedem empfehlen, der auf der Suche nach einem hochwertigen Bildschirm f\u00fcr Gaming ist.

                "text": "The brand is enoughNice qualityGood connectivityLonger operational durationNice feel and handful.Easy to handle.Cheaper price.Recommended.;I recently purchased the Dell Mouse for the third time, and while it still maintains its reputation for a solid and reliable performance, there have been some unexpected changes that I feel compelled to address.In my previous encounters with this mouse, the distinctive red light used to be a notable feature, adding a touch of elegance and uniqueness to its appearance. However, this time around, it appears that Dell has disabled the red light, purportedly in the pursuit of enhancing battery efficiency. While I can appreciate the desire for longer battery life, I couldn't help but miss the visual appeal that the red light brought to the table.Upon receiving the product, I was initially concerned to find that the sensor light was not functioning. However, much to my relief, the mouse itself was fully functional and performed seamlessly, even in the absence of the red light. This is a testament to the mouse's core capabilities and engineering, as it managed to operate flawlessly despite this minor setback.Pros:1. Reliable performance: The mouse continues to function flawlessly, delivering precise cursor movements and smooth clicking.2. Battery efficiency: The decision to disable the red light in favor of improved battery life is a sensible one for users who prioritize extended usage between charges.3. Ergonomic design: The mouse's ergonomic shape and comfortable grip ensure long hours of usage without discomfort.Cons:1. Disabled red light: The omission of the red light, while understandable from a battery efficiency standpoint, takes away from the mouse's visual appeal.2. Non-functional sensor light: The absence of a functioning sensor light upon receipt can be initially concerning, even though the mouse operates as expected.In conclusion, the Dell Mouse retains its status as a reliable and dependable peripheral, living up to its reputation for seamless performance. The decision to disable the red light in favor of enhanced battery efficiency might divide opinions, with some appreciating the extended usage time and others missing the distinct aesthetic it brought. The non-functional sensor light upon receipt is a minor hiccup, overshadowed by the mouse's overall functionality. For those seeking a dependable and straightforward mouse experience, this Dell Mouse remains a solid choice.;I've been using this mouse for close to 2 years now. This mouse has worked exceptionally well. It's indeed value for money. For this price range, the mouse worked so well. I've never experienced any issues or lag with the mouse. It connects instantly with my Windows & Mac laptop. I'd definitely recommend this mouse to everyone who's looking for a wireless mouse in this range.;Worst roduct. I have ordered this on Dec 11th with COD option. i have received the product which is not working. I tried to replace the item but from amazon no is response.;First of all. The build quality and rest of the features are great. But it's side scroll and extra button features are made ONLY FOR PEOPLE TO USE IN MICROSOFT APPLICATIONS, NOTHING ELSE. If you are that person, go for it. But if you like to get the most of a device I'd suggest you go for Logitech MX master. It's fractionally higher priced than this one and is loaded with features. With the features this one has its not worth half it's price.;The Dell WM118 Wireless Mouse is a solid choice for anyone in need of a reliable and efficient peripheral. With 1000 DPI optical tracking, it offers smooth and accurate cursor control, making it great for everyday tasks. The 2.4 GHz wireless connection ensures a stable link to your computer, and the USB nano receiver is small and unobtrusive.One of the best features is its impressive 12-month battery life, which means you can use it without constantly worrying about recharging or replacing the battery. The mouse is also comfortable to use, with a simple, ergonomic design that fits well in hand.Overall, the Dell WM118 is a dependable wireless mouse that delivers excellent performance at an affordable price. Highly recommended!;Good design, good functionlity, good scrolling speed,Noiseless scrolling,  but the mouse is noisy when we click everytime.;I am happy with my purchase. the only concern is the light that appeared when the mouse was turned on. The light is missing, which does not allow to know whether the mouse is on or off. Overall it is handy, light weight and very much usable on all surfaces.;Sem problemas, funcionando perfeitamente;Nice travel mouse, doesn't take too much space. Good size if your mobile all the time.;Entrega r\u00e1pida y oportuna me lleg\u00f3 mi factura;Works well with my Dell laptop. Sensitive and accurate. Comfortable.;La qualit\u00e9 Dell",

As other brands not offering extending your RAM, this has 2 dedicated slots for ram (ram can be removed, not soldered) where you can have another 8gb ram as well.Also i see youtubers are promoting worstly now days like laptops can be used by youtubers(for editing), students and gamers. Dont know whey they discuss on narow bezzle, laptops not eating display size from years ago.Dont think with dell will get omlet with that heat. Charge if laptop not in use and dont use lap for movies and games when in charge. so that you may get better battery backup also.Finally i can say its best buy, rich look, sounds good, performance good, display is good, Cam is ok as expected and as required.regarding price, during duserra this price is 62,XXX/- with offers you can get for 60k. what's the point in  doing business. all i understood is Business = Lie.;Clock speed is not as mentioned in the description.There's no high performance mode.Backlit keyboard is goodOverall product is nice .;Got the laptop at a fairly good deal and for the moment, it's a great laptop. The build quality is great and something that we've come to love and appreciate from Dell. Comes with an i5 11th gen processor so it's very prompt. Battery backup is good. 64 bit with 8GB ram and 1TB storage. It's a non touch screen display. Very good value for money.;I bought a Dell laptop online a couple of years ago, and initially, I was satisfied with its performance. As a mild user, I primarily used it for basic tasks like browsing and work. I didn\u2019t even use it for media consumption, unlike others who might use their laptops for entertainment. For the first two years, everything seemed fine. However, after about two years of use, I started facing issues. Some of the keys on the keyboard completely stopped working, which was frustrating since I had only used it lightly. I had to resort to using the virtual keyboard just to get by.The situation only worsened after another year. By the time the laptop was three years old, the motherboard completely failed, rendering the laptop useless. Given that I hadn\u2019t pushed the laptop hard or used it for heavy tasks, I expected it to last much longer. The fact that it broke down so soon was incredibly disappointing.To make matters worse, when I bought the laptop, it came with a no return policy. This meant that when I received a defective unit, I was stuck with it for a while. Eventually, after some effort, I was able to get a replacement, but the process was frustrating and time-consuming.Looking back, I deeply regret purchasing this laptop online, especially from Dell. The product\u2019s durability was far below expectations, and the lack of support during this process was frustrating. If you're considering buying a laptop from Dell or online, I would strongly recommend you think twice. For the price, it wasn\u2019t worth it, and I\u2019m now questioning the reliability of the brand.;Product is too good .but battery back too low more than 3 hours;In Ubuntu, speaker is not working well otherwise all good.;Good battery life lasts upto 6 hours. And also it's light weight. Packaging was very good. Also having Backlit.;Over heat \ud83d\udd25issues. Battery draining",

Hope I will get one.;I am writing this review after almost 1.5 years of using the laptop.I had purchased this product in May 2023 from Amazon and this is what happened in August 2023, fortunately, the laptop was in the warranty period, so Dell team repaired it with no extra charges. However, I am facing similar issue again in September 2024. I believe, that the product's hardware quality is extremely low resulting in such damages.Battery drains very fast.You have to frequently keep updating the software/ internal programs or else they will malfunctionIn terms of other performance its good, it doesn't hang. but of you are looking for a durable laptop this is not the one to be chosen.Further up updating my review on 16 November 2024The same problem arised again and this the second time in 1.5 years that it has happened the same hinge and screen broke.Worst product;Worth full wonderful laptop n great deal;Laptop really good for smooth and speedy functions. Installed applications are working well. How ever there is no indication about the period of license available for  Microsoft Office etc. anywhere in the purchase details. This hidden details where one need to care at the time of buying;I have ordered this product in January 2023 during Amazon Sales but after the sale price was dropped. I don't know whom to blame for this price game Amazon or seller. This Laptop is not for gaming purpose however good enough for office purpose. MS Office some times get hanged. No backlit and No ethernet port is major drawback of the product. Dell should work on it.;So far so good;1 ghante use krte hi laptop band ho gya ... Pathetic quality...

I primarily use this laptop for trading, watching movies, and general productivity tasks, and it has proven to be more than capable for all my needs.**Performance and Display:**Equipped with an Intel 12th Gen Core i3 processor and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop delivers smooth and responsive performance, even when multitasking between multiple applications. The 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a stunning visual experience, making movies come to life and enhancing the fluidity of my trading charts.**Portability and Build Quality:**Weighing just 1.69kg and featuring a thin and lightweight design, the Dell 15 is easy to carry around, whether I'm working from home or on the go. The spill-resistant keyboard adds a layer of durability, giving me peace of mind against accidental spills during long trading sessions or movie marathons.**Value for Money:**At a price of 29k, this laptop offers exceptional value for money. With its solid performance, vibrant display, and practical features, it competes favorably with higher-priced alternatives on the market. For a first-time laptop buyer like myself, it's reassuring to know that I've made a wise investment in a reliable and versatile computing device.**Future Updates:**I plan to update this review after six months of using the Dell 15, providing valuable insights into its long-term performance, durability, and any additional features or drawbacks I may discover over time. This will be helpful for others who are considering purchasing the same laptop and are looking for real-world experiences.**Final Thoughts:**Overall, the Dell 15 has been an outstanding first laptop for me. Its combination of performance, display quality, portability, and affordability makes it an ideal choice for users looking for a versatile companion for everyday computing tasks. Whether you're a student, professional, or casual user, the Dell 15 delivers a compelling user experience that punches above its price point. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for their first laptop or a reliable upgrade.Edit: today 7 September 2024 my hinges broked but because of dell service they replaced my hinges and laptop upper body \ud83d\udc45 , Hinges were hard and after replacement they're very smooth like Amul butter. Zero rupees replacement! Just call customer care and told everything! Within 2 days engineer visit and fixed it!, check my images and videos.Overall laptop is great \ud83d\ude38! I bought this laptop only 29k because of credit card discount..;I ordered this laptop and I had received old and used laptop in open box. Orignal box was open which was kept inside good amazon outer box, so I couldn't check open box while taking laptop delivery. See below issues that I faced and need your attention so that you save your money.Open box, used laptopI order 14\" laptop and received 15.9\" display.It was getting Heat too much in this cold winter weather.When pressed power switch thrice it turns on.Some times there is black screen and only cursor visible. Twice it happened.Faulty product, was looking like refurbished computer.This seller is selling faulty product. Be aware. It's good to buy from local shop.Configuration is same as described.There are 21% , 1star review;Over all good product, Battery exhaust fast.;The media could not be loaded.It Is Very Ideal For Work And Without Lagging. Very Handy To Use, Feels Like A Book & Is Light. Very Clear Display. Very Satisfied From Amazon. We Were Initially Worried About Quality But It Is The Best By Value.You Can Go For It For Office Working. Used For 4 Hours 100% to 15% In Full Use.;Received my system on 27th February, Completed system configuration, yet to start using.Positive - Received in company (Dell) packing, and Amazon box on top of it, lot of protection inside, brand new piece, verily slim look \u2026 Overall look and feel is Brilliant\u2026Shall write more about performance once I start using itThanks everyone for your attention;I purchased this laptop on the 18th and today is the 24th. I have read a lot of reviews complaining about heating issues and yes they are right. This laptop is a heater. It will be very helpful during the winter season.But I am keeping this as I have liked it and that's why the good 3 stars I am giving.When you use any laptop for the first few days, it heats up pretty badly because of a lot of updates going on in the background. I was almost scared when I see it heats up super bad and was thinking to return it. But that was just one time. But still, it heats up more than a normal laptop should. I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work. I just purchased it as a backup laptop because my main laptop Asus Vivobook runs 14 to 18hrs a day for the last 5 yrs and it needs some rest.Personally, I won't recommend this laptop. Maybe try Asus or HP. Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though. Will update after 4-5 months of usage and re-write proper review after 1 year of usageEdit: 21st August 2024.Well, on 14th August, 2024, laptop stopped working. I sent it to Dell repair and found motherboard is dead. They need to replace it whole.So I am not recommending this laptop. People say right. Never bought expensive stuffs online. This is 4th laptop and 1st online and so huge issue. Motherboard estimation is 16500 right now. Luckily I have insurance, I am not sure how much will they cover. My Asus, HP, Compaq and Macbook never got motherboard issue and all lasted long. This one gave so big issues even from start and now look at it.",

                "text": "I recently purchased the Dell 15 Thin & Light Laptop, and so far, I'm quite impressed. It packs a Core i5-1235U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, which makes multitasking smooth and quick. The 15.6\" FHD display is sharp and offers great visuals whether I'm streaming videos or working on documents.What stands out for me is how lightweight it is\u2014just 1.66kg\u2014making it super portable without feeling flimsy. Despite its slim design, the laptop feels sturdy, and the spill-resistant keyboard is a nice touch for added peace of mind.Another bonus is the pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office 2021, so I was ready to work right out of the box. The inclusion of 15 months of McAfee security is a nice plus, especially if you're cautious about online threats.If I had to nitpick, 8GB of RAM is decent for everyday tasks but may not be enough for more intensive work or gaming. Also, the build, while durable, does attract fingerprints, especially on the black finish.Overall, this is an excellent laptop for students, professionals, or anyone needing a reliable machine for daily use without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for its performance, portability, and value!;As soon as the 1year warranty period is over the laptop stopped working. It gets hanged or dropped out when I'm in a meeting. Also it gets hanged when I'm trying to open an excell or any file. I've been trying to reach the customer support as well but they don't take you call or respond to message. Worst customer service and worst product. Please don't buy it.;;Worth buying this, thx.;Fear that...it may blast;nice;I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare. Right out of the box, there was a glaring green dot on the screen that refuses to go away, and the camera is unstable, making it impossible to use for work or meetings.I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to help. When I contacted Dell, their so-called \"support\" team told me they could only replace the LED/ED screen and couldn\u2019t even provide me with a DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter. How does that even make sense for a brand-new product?I trusted Amazon and Dell to deliver a quality product and back it up with proper service, but I\u2019ve been left stuck in the middle with no solution. Both companies are shirking their responsibilities, and now I\u2019m stuck with a defective laptop.This is unacceptable from two major companies that are supposed to be industry leaders. I will think twice before purchasing anything from Amazon or Dell again. Buyers beware! Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.;light weight, good portability, decent looks , good built quality, battery lasts 5-6 hrs for normal use , lasts 8 hrs on battery saver mode if you do light works .  All well except one  issue that is it starts lagging /stuttering, videos get hung if you use the laptop while charging due to overheating . But this problem is solved by using better cooling solution like using laptop bottom riser while charging. Dont forget to buy a laptop riser along with this product.",

                "text": "The Dell Inspiron 5440 is a budget-friendly, mid-range laptop ideal for daily tasks like web browsing, word processing, and light media consumption. It offers good performance with Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and SSD storage, making it suitable for light multitasking and moderate workloads. The design is sleek and portable, with a solid build and comfortable keyboard. The 14-inch Full HD display is decent for indoor use, though not as vibrant as premium models. The battery lasts 6 to 8 hours on a full charge, depending on usage. It offers a variety of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and Ethernet, plus Wi-Fi 6 for fast connectivity. The audio quality is fine for casual use but lacks depth. Overall, the Inspiron 5440 offers great value for users needing a reliable laptop for everyday tasks, though it\u2019s not suited for intensive gaming or content creation.;Amazon customer care responded but we have to be on roads in traffic up and down but no solution;Delivered product specifications are not maching with what they advertising.;The Dell Inspiron 5440 is a mid-range laptop that provides solid performance for daily computing tasks, making it a great option for users looking for a reliable, budget-friendly device. Here's a detailed review of its features:Performance:The Dell Inspiron 5440 typically comes with a range of processors, including Intel Core i5 or Core i7, which offer solid performance for most everyday tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, and media consumption. The laptop is also suitable for light multitasking and light media editing. While it\u2019s not a high-performance machine for gaming or intensive content creation (like video editing), it can handle casual gaming at low to medium settings and moderate workloads without significant slowdowns.Depending on the configuration, you might also get 8GB or 16GB RAM, which provides smooth multitasking, and 256GB or 512GB SSD options for faster boot times and quick file access. For most users, this setup is more than enough for daily productivity and light entertainment.Design & Build Quality:The Dell Inspiron 5440 has a clean, modern design with a plastic chassis and metal accents. The build is solid for its price range, but it doesn\u2019t have the premium feel of higher-end models like the XPS series. It\u2019s relatively lightweight and portable, weighing around 1.5 to 1.7 kg, making it convenient for students or professionals who need a laptop for work or on-the-go tasks.The keyboard is comfortable for typing, with well-spaced keys and decent travel, while the trackpad is responsive and supports multi-touch gestures.Display:The 14-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) display provides decent clarity and sharpness for work tasks, media consumption, and browsing. The color accuracy and brightness are generally good for indoor use, but it may fall short in direct sunlight or bright environments. For most users, it offers a solid viewing experience for typical usage, but it's not as vibrant as the displays found in more premium models.Battery Life:The battery life on the Inspiron 5440 is typically good for a full day of light office tasks, with an estimated 6 to 8 hours of use on a full charge. This will depend on the specific configuration and your usage, but it's generally reliable enough for most users. For more intensive tasks like video streaming or gaming, the battery will drain faster.Ports & Connectivity:The Dell Inspiron 5440 offers a variety of useful ports, including:USB-A (2.0 and 3.0)USB-CHDMI (for connecting to external monitors)Ethernet port (for wired internet connection)SD card reader (helpful for transferring photos or files)Headphone jackThese ports make it versatile for connecting external devices like storage drives, monitors, or headphones.The laptop also offers Wi-Fi 6 for faster internet connectivity and Bluetooth for wireless accessories.Sound:The audio quality is decent for casual media consumption. The built-in speakers are fine for video calls or listening to music in a quiet environment, but they lack depth and bass. For more immersive audio experiences, you might want to use headphones or external speakers.Overall Value:The Dell Inspiron 5440 is a great value laptop for users who need a dependable device for everyday tasks like browsing, word processing, light media consumption, and light productivity. It offers good performance for the price, solid build quality, and long battery life, making it an excellent choice for students, remote workers, and budget-conscious professionals.Final Thoughts:If you\u2019re looking for a reliable laptop that covers all the basics and offers decent performance without a high price tag, the Dell Inspiron 5440 is a solid choice. It\u2019s not a powerhouse for gaming or intensive creative work, but it offers good value for money with a reliable design, solid battery life, and satisfactory performance for everyday tasks.;Recently, I have purchased a dell laptop model inspiron 5440 (intel core 7 processor) from dell online store. I would like to share my experience.I would never suggest any one to buy Dell laptop. I have heard before from my friends that Dell laptops are not good, you should never buy them. But, i did not listen to them and purchased this laptop spending a huge sum. I must tell you, the initial one was pathetic. I was facing one issue after another.They call it thin an light model, but its fan never stop rotating. I have seen so many laptop with similar price range. At least for non of the them, the fan makes these loud noise. Thus i tried contacting dell technical support. They told me, mam, for this model the fan will make this loud noise. There is no solution to it. After that, they remotely installed some software.Next, i faced speaker issue. There was no sound coming out of my laptop. Again i contacted the dell technical team, they did some thing and it was working fine. But at the same time laptop became slow.So the technical expert next reset my pc. She was suggesting me to reinstall the operating system also. I told her, it has been only 5 days i bought this laptop, is it necessary.Now also when i am writing this review, my fan keeps on rotating.I, being from a middle class family, spend our hard earned money, to buy a good laptop for study purchase. But, i realized now, i have lost a huge sum of  money by spending it on this laptop.Dell website says , you can return our product in 14 days if you don't like it. But their technical support person says neither we will replace it nor you can return it. That means \"Even if you got a defective piece you should keep it\".I can not get back my money. But at least you should not spend a penny on this useless dell product. I hope my review helps you to make better judgment regarding purchase of dell product. My personal suggestion is please don't buy it.  I have been on so much mental stress these days because of the amount of money i spent on this product. And the inspiron 5440 turns out to be total waste;This laptop performs something in between the apple M1 and M2 chip air models. Can do the processor intensive tasks easily but gaming obviously suffers since it is a professional laptop.",

                "text": "My monitor is of 22 inches. Tilt option is there. Height adjustment is there. Look wise it's a premium monitor. Even we can rotate the monitor 180 degrees for portrait mode. HDMI cable won't come along with it. Only DP cable will be in package. I am not a gamer so I can't comment on on that front. But for my work it's pretty good. USB port is there but not sure how to use it. I have connected DP cable to my laptop but nothing happened. I am not sure about the use of DP cable. But when I inserted the HDMI cable then it immediately recognized the display.Suggestion: If anyone wants to have a monitor on IKEA MICKE table then better to purchase 20 inch monitor. If you have a nice and wide table at your home then you can go with 22 inch monitor.;Fine... working fine .... Do recommend to others too.;I was looking for a high quality monitor for WFH setup with height adjustment and swivel. The height and tilt adjustment is very useful for long working hours where you keep changing sitting position, attend long calls. It is very relaxing to attend call while standing near desk. Also there is enough space if you up uplift the monitor to max height and keep laptop below it. The 2 screen will be like stack on each other. Earlier I was looking for model - P2219H, but it was out of stock. Then found P2222H  is better in look, boarder less design and 2021 year model. So I ordered it and highly satisfied for working needs. By the way Dell is my all time favorite brand from college days.  The 24 inch model is little bigger but my preference was 22 inch model. I mostly switch work with 14 inch laptop. So choosing for 22 inch monitor instead 24 is best as it brings down screen gap. One thing, there is no speaker in the monitor and it comes with 13 Amp plug. You may need to buy a 6 amp plug. There is HDMI VGA and Display port with USB hub.The 22 inch monitor have another advantage as it consume less power than 24 inch, I manged to run it almost 2 hour on my APC BACK UPS 600.It has 3 years onsite warranty.;Likes: color reproduction is very good as it has IPS panel.Height adjustment.360 degree rotatable.Dislike: nothing as of now.Used for: i am using it my home office software development purposes.;Low power and excellent picture quality.;The media could not be loaded.Defective piece sent by Seller. For which Amazon is guiding with false resolution to get their positive feedback and very rude in conversation and disconnecting the calls without any giving any resolution;So far the product is good.  I see one issue that Dell has not paid attention to it. You can not change its Height. This is not height adjustable monitor. You can only tilt.;Good. Worth for money;De excel\u00eancia. Sugest\u00e3o: O suporte poderia permitir instalar o note na vertical, facilitando o desempenho de quem trabalha com o word.;Lo compr\u00e9 en promoci\u00f3n en el buen fin y vale mucho la pena. Es perfecto para un escritorio mediano.;I have no opinion on the bundled stand as I used the monitor on an arm.PROS:* almost zero bezel on three sides* built-in power supply, so no need to hide the power brick* built-in usb3 hub with 4 downstream ports* all the cables bundledCONS:* no speakers or even a headphone outlet - that's the only bummer* refresh rate limited to 60HzLooks like a perfect small monitor to me!;Although it feels like it took forever to come, when I got here it was totally worth the wait! I love this monitor!;The monitor turned out to be smaller than I anticipated, and I found the proportions of height and width to be less than ideal. The length was also longer than I would have preferred.Returned it.",

Hope I will get one.;I am writing this review after almost 1.5 years of using the laptop.I had purchased this product in May 2023 from Amazon and this is what happened in August 2023, fortunately, the laptop was in the warranty period, so Dell team repaired it with no extra charges. However, I am facing similar issue again in September 2024. I believe, that the product's hardware quality is extremely low resulting in such damages.Battery drains very fast.You have to frequently keep updating the software/ internal programs or else they will malfunctionIn terms of other performance its good, it doesn't hang. but of you are looking for a durable laptop this is not the one to be chosen.Further up updating my review on 16 November 2024The same problem arised again and this the second time in 1.5 years that it has happened the same hinge and screen broke.Worst product;Worth full wonderful laptop n great deal;Laptop really good for smooth and speedy functions. Installed applications are working well. How ever there is no indication about the period of license available for  Microsoft Office etc. anywhere in the purchase details. This hidden details where one need to care at the time of buying;I have ordered this product in January 2023 during Amazon Sales but after the sale price was dropped. I don't know whom to blame for this price game Amazon or seller. This Laptop is not for gaming purpose however good enough for office purpose. MS Office some times get hanged. No backlit and No ethernet port is major drawback of the product. Dell should work on it.;So far so good;1 ghante use krte hi laptop band ho gya ... Pathetic quality...

So my new feedback is not to buy at all;Great renewed product, a few very minor cosmetic blemishes bit nothing serious, works great with my 2018 Dell XPS thunderbolt 3 laptop with 4K touch screen. Need to read the manual to understand the power on behavior (fan runs for a few seconds), power button function (works same as laptop power function for DELL computers ONLY) and what connections support what resolutions - for 2 external 4K 3840 x 2160 @60Hz displays must use the usbc Thunderbolt and either the display port or hdmi port.

It offers good performance with Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and SSD storage, making it suitable for light multitasking and moderate workloads. The design is sleek and portable, with a solid build and comfortable keyboard. The 14-inch Full HD display is decent for indoor use, though not as vibrant as premium models. The battery lasts 6 to 8 hours on a full charge, depending on usage. It offers a variety of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and Ethernet, plus Wi-Fi 6 for fast connectivity. The audio quality is fine for casual use but lacks depth. Overall, the Inspiron 5440 offers great value for users needing a reliable laptop for everyday tasks, though it\u2019s not suited for intensive gaming or content creation.;Amazon customer care responded but we have to be on roads in traffic up and down but no solution;Delivered product specifications are not maching with what they advertising.;The Dell Inspiron 5440 is a mid-range laptop that provides solid performance for daily computing tasks, making it a great option for users looking for a reliable, budget-friendly device. Here's a detailed review of its features:Performance:The Dell Inspiron 5440 typically comes with a range of processors, including Intel Core i5 or Core i7, which offer solid performance for most everyday tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, and media consumption. The laptop is also suitable for light multitasking and light media editing. While it\u2019s not a high-performance machine for gaming or intensive content creation (like video editing), it can handle casual gaming at low to medium settings and moderate workloads without significant slowdowns.Depending on the configuration, you might also get 8GB or 16GB RAM, which provides smooth multitasking, and 256GB or 512GB SSD options for faster boot times and quick file access. For most users, this setup is more than enough for daily productivity and light entertainment.Design & Build Quality:The Dell Inspiron 5440 has a clean, modern design with a plastic chassis and metal accents. The build is solid for its price range, but it doesn\u2019t have the premium feel of higher-end models like the XPS series. It\u2019s relatively lightweight and portable, weighing around 1.5 to 1.7 kg, making it convenient for students or professionals who need a laptop for work or on-the-go tasks.The keyboard is comfortable for typing, with well-spaced keys and decent travel, while the trackpad is responsive and supports multi-touch gestures.Display:The 14-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) display provides decent clarity and sharpness for work tasks, media consumption, and browsing. The color accuracy and brightness are generally good for indoor use, but it may fall short in direct sunlight or bright environments. For most users, it offers a solid viewing experience for typical usage, but it's not as vibrant as the displays found in more premium models.Battery Life:The battery life on the Inspiron 5440 is typically good for a full day of light office tasks, with an estimated 6 to 8 hours of use on a full charge. This will depend on the specific configuration and your usage, but it's generally reliable enough for most users. For more intensive tasks like video streaming or gaming, the battery will drain faster.Ports & Connectivity:The Dell Inspiron 5440 offers a variety of useful ports, including:USB-A (2.0 and 3.0)USB-CHDMI (for connecting to external monitors)Ethernet port (for wired internet connection)SD card reader (helpful for transferring photos or files)Headphone jackThese ports make it versatile for connecting external devices like storage drives, monitors, or headphones.The laptop also offers Wi-Fi 6 for faster internet connectivity and Bluetooth for wireless accessories.Sound:The audio quality is decent for casual media consumption. The built-in speakers are fine for video calls or listening to music in a quiet environment, but they lack depth and bass. For more immersive audio experiences, you might want to use headphones or external speakers.Overall Value:The Dell Inspiron 5440 is a great value laptop for users who need a dependable device for everyday tasks like browsing, word processing, light media consumption, and light productivity. It offers good performance for the price, solid build quality, and long battery life, making it an excellent choice for students, remote workers, and budget-conscious professionals.Final Thoughts:If you\u2019re looking for a reliable laptop that covers all the basics and offers decent performance without a high price tag, the Dell Inspiron 5440 is a solid choice. It\u2019s not a powerhouse for gaming or intensive creative work, but it offers good value for money with a reliable design, solid battery life, and satisfactory performance for everyday tasks.;Recently, I have purchased a dell laptop model inspiron 5440 (intel core 7 processor) from dell online store. I would like to share my experience.I would never suggest any one to buy Dell laptop. I have heard before from my friends that Dell laptops are not good, you should never buy them. But, i did not listen to them and purchased this laptop spending a huge sum. I must tell you, the initial one was pathetic. I was facing one issue after another.They call it thin an light model, but its fan never stop rotating. I have seen so many laptop with similar price range. At least for non of the them, the fan makes these loud noise. Thus i tried contacting dell technical support. They told me, mam, for this model the fan will make this loud noise. There is no solution to it. After that, they remotely installed some software.Next, i faced speaker issue. There was no sound coming out of my laptop. Again i contacted the dell technical team, they did some thing and it was working fine. But at the same time laptop became slow.So the technical expert next reset my pc. She was suggesting me to reinstall the operating system also. I told her, it has been only 5 days i bought this laptop, is it necessary.Now also when i am writing this review, my fan keeps on rotating.I, being from a middle class family, spend our hard earned money, to buy a good laptop for study purchase. But, i realized now, i have lost a huge sum of  money by spending it on this laptop.Dell website says , you can return our product in 14 days if you don't like it. But their technical support person says neither we will replace it nor you can return it. That means \"Even if you got a defective piece you should keep it\".I can not get back my money. But at least you should not spend a penny on this useless dell product. I hope my review helps you to make better judgment regarding purchase of dell product. My personal suggestion is please don't buy it.  I have been on so much mental stress these days because of the amount of money i spent on this product. And the inspiron 5440 turns out to be total waste;This laptop performs something in between the apple M1 and M2 chip air models. Can do the processor intensive tasks easily but gaming obviously suffers since it is a professional laptop.",

                "text": "The media could not be loaded.As a first-time laptop user, the Dell 15 has exceeded my expectations with its excellent performance and versatile features. I primarily use this laptop for trading, watching movies, and general productivity tasks, and it has proven to be more than capable for all my needs.**Performance and Display:**Equipped with an Intel 12th Gen Core i3 processor and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop delivers smooth and responsive performance, even when multitasking between multiple applications. The 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a stunning visual experience, making movies come to life and enhancing the fluidity of my trading charts.**Portability and Build Quality:**Weighing just 1.69kg and featuring a thin and lightweight design, the Dell 15 is easy to carry around, whether I'm working from home or on the go. The spill-resistant keyboard adds a layer of durability, giving me peace of mind against accidental spills during long trading sessions or movie marathons.**Value for Money:**At a price of 29k, this laptop offers exceptional value for money. With its solid performance, vibrant display, and practical features, it competes favorably with higher-priced alternatives on the market. For a first-time laptop buyer like myself, it's reassuring to know that I've made a wise investment in a reliable and versatile computing device.**Future Updates:**I plan to update this review after six months of using the Dell 15, providing valuable insights into its long-term performance, durability, and any additional features or drawbacks I may discover over time. This will be helpful for others who are considering purchasing the same laptop and are looking for real-world experiences.**Final Thoughts:**Overall, the Dell 15 has been an outstanding first laptop for me. Its combination of performance, display quality, portability, and affordability makes it an ideal choice for users looking for a versatile companion for everyday computing tasks. Whether you're a student, professional, or casual user, the Dell 15 delivers a compelling user experience that punches above its price point. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for their first laptop or a reliable upgrade.Edit: today 7 September 2024 my hinges broked but because of dell service they replaced my hinges and laptop upper body \ud83d\udc45 , Hinges were hard and after replacement they're very smooth like Amul butter. Zero rupees replacement! Just call customer care and told everything! Within 2 days engineer visit and fixed it!, check my images and videos.Overall laptop is great \ud83d\ude38! I bought this laptop only 29k because of credit card discount..;I ordered this laptop and I had received old and used laptop in open box. Orignal box was open which was kept inside good amazon outer box, so I couldn't check open box while taking laptop delivery. See below issues that I faced and need your attention so that you save your money.Open box, used laptopI order 14\" laptop and received 15.9\" display.It was getting Heat too much in this cold winter weather.When pressed power switch thrice it turns on.Some times there is black screen and only cursor visible. Twice it happened.Faulty product, was looking like refurbished computer.This seller is selling faulty product. Be aware. It's good to buy from local shop.Configuration is same as described.There are 21% , 1star review;Over all good product, Battery exhaust fast.;The media could not be loaded.It Is Very Ideal For Work And Without Lagging. Very Handy To Use, Feels Like A Book & Is Light. Very Clear Display. Very Satisfied From Amazon. We Were Initially Worried About Quality But It Is The Best By Value.You Can Go For It For Office Working. Used For 4 Hours 100% to 15% In Full Use.;Received my system on 27th February, Completed system configuration, yet to start using.Positive - Received in company (Dell) packing, and Amazon box on top of it, lot of protection inside, brand new piece, verily slim look \u2026 Overall look and feel is Brilliant\u2026Shall write more about performance once I start using itThanks everyone for your attention;I purchased this laptop on the 18th and today is the 24th. I have read a lot of reviews complaining about heating issues and yes they are right. This laptop is a heater. It will be very helpful during the winter season.But I am keeping this as I have liked it and that's why the good 3 stars I am giving.When you use any laptop for the first few days, it heats up pretty badly because of a lot of updates going on in the background. I was almost scared when I see it heats up super bad and was thinking to return it. But that was just one time. But still, it heats up more than a normal laptop should. I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work. I just purchased it as a backup laptop because my main laptop Asus Vivobook runs 14 to 18hrs a day for the last 5 yrs and it needs some rest.Personally, I won't recommend this laptop. Maybe try Asus or HP. Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though. Will update after 4-5 months of usage and re-write proper review after 1 year of usageEdit: 21st August 2024.Well, on 14th August, 2024, laptop stopped working. I sent it to Dell repair and found motherboard is dead. They need to replace it whole.So I am not recommending this laptop. People say right. Never bought expensive stuffs online. This is 4th laptop and 1st online and so huge issue. Motherboard estimation is 16500 right now. Luckily I have insurance, I am not sure how much will they cover. My Asus, HP, Compaq and Macbook never got motherboard issue and all lasted long. This one gave so big issues even from start and now look at it.",

IPS panel color production is better, but at best compare to VA panel. Keep in mind no speaker on monitor, it uses laptop speaker for media. Rest for office works, it's works like charm. Brought 27in, if u have deck space go for it. Overall 5 star based on my usage (documents, excel, presentation, emails and other office works);Nice product. Screen view is good.;This is good product and so far satisfied with performance. Majorly used for office work;Again as I said it doesn't have 75 hz maybe it reaches it when you put it in FPS Mode but ghosting is very bad if you do that. Aside from the the monitor is very good but lacks depthcolors are a little washed out for a computer monitor IPS panel is average. The stand is meh quality but get's the job done the tilting is good tho  I would give it a thumbs up over all since it's quality is overall higher because the monitor without the stand is pretty good in quality. Not worth over amazon absoc ones tho my friend has it and it's better in quality overall;Not recommended, HDMI cable was damaged, showing red dots on monitor screen. Working good with different HDMI cable;Enough to beginners..to use pc for vedio mixing tutorials;Complete package and DELL brand trust.;Everything is ok but no so good for office use because of large size;Lindo mas pra quem precisa de alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o tem como, essa quantidade de pixels fica a boa para no m\u00e1ximo 24\u201d;Excelente produto.

Equipped with an Intel i5-12500H processor, 16GB DDR5 RAM, and a 512GB SSD, this laptop delivers an ultimate gaming experience. The NVIDIA RTX 3050 (4GB GDDR6) graphics card ensures smooth and immersive gameplay, making every session a visual treat.The 15.6\" FHD WVA AG 120Hz display with 250 nits of brightness provides superb screen quality, perfect for both gaming and multimedia consumption. The vibrant colors and sharp details enhance the overall visual experience. The backlit keyboard with an orange hue adds a stylish touch, making it a pleasure to use even in low-light conditions.Despite its many strengths, the laptop does have one notable drawback\u2014the battery life. Given its substantial weight and heavy-duty battery, I expected it to last at least three hours on a single charge. However, I was disappointed to find that the battery life only allows for about half an hour of gaming. This short battery life can be a significant inconvenience, especially for gamers who enjoy long sessions without being tethered to a power outlet.Aside from the battery issue, my experience with the Dell G15 5520 has been excellent. The laptop's performance, screen quality, and overall build make it a fantastic choice for gamers and power users alike.

                "text": "I recently purchased the Dell 15 Thin & Light Laptop, and so far, I'm quite impressed. It packs a Core i5-1235U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, which makes multitasking smooth and quick. The 15.6\" FHD display is sharp and offers great visuals whether I'm streaming videos or working on documents.What stands out for me is how lightweight it is\u2014just 1.66kg\u2014making it super portable without feeling flimsy. Despite its slim design, the laptop feels sturdy, and the spill-resistant keyboard is a nice touch for added peace of mind.Another bonus is the pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office 2021, so I was ready to work right out of the box. The inclusion of 15 months of McAfee security is a nice plus, especially if you're cautious about online threats.If I had to nitpick, 8GB of RAM is decent for everyday tasks but may not be enough for more intensive work or gaming. Also, the build, while durable, does attract fingerprints, especially on the black finish.Overall, this is an excellent laptop for students, professionals, or anyone needing a reliable machine for daily use without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for its performance, portability, and value!;As soon as the 1year warranty period is over the laptop stopped working. It gets hanged or dropped out when I'm in a meeting. Also it gets hanged when I'm trying to open an excell or any file. I've been trying to reach the customer support as well but they don't take you call or respond to message. Worst customer service and worst product. Please don't buy it.;;Worth buying this, thx.;Fear that...it may blast;nice;I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare. Right out of the box, there was a glaring green dot on the screen that refuses to go away, and the camera is unstable, making it impossible to use for work or meetings.I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to help. When I contacted Dell, their so-called \"support\" team told me they could only replace the LED/ED screen and couldn\u2019t even provide me with a DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter. How does that even make sense for a brand-new product?I trusted Amazon and Dell to deliver a quality product and back it up with proper service, but I\u2019ve been left stuck in the middle with no solution. Both companies are shirking their responsibilities, and now I\u2019m stuck with a defective laptop.This is unacceptable from two major companies that are supposed to be industry leaders. I will think twice before purchasing anything from Amazon or Dell again. Buyers beware! Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.;light weight, good portability, decent looks , good built quality, battery lasts 5-6 hrs for normal use , lasts 8 hrs on battery saver mode if you do light works .  All well except one  issue that is it starts lagging /stuttering, videos get hung if you use the laptop while charging due to overheating . But this problem is solved by using better cooling solution like using laptop bottom riser while charging. Dont forget to buy a laptop riser along with this product.",

Dell MK5221W I bought this as it is midway between features Vs Price Point MK235 (Basic) and MK7321W. Advanced MK7321W has Features like 1. \"Muti Device\" Combo used across mutiple Device like Windows, Apple system with click of button with Bluetooth5.0 and 2. \"Universal Pairing\" use wireless+mouse across multiple devices by changing remote \"Universal non-systrm specific Programmable\" USB Dongle) and 3.

Dell MK5221W gives midway features with \"Universal Pairing\" + \"Programmable Keyboard 12 keys + Mouse Roll Wheel Tilt (only left + Center key, Not found in basic). Please Google on wireless keybaord / mouse \"Muti Device\" or \"Universal Pairing\" to know more on features to understand what you want to pay for.Next on Logitech MK240 (Logitech very cheap version of Dell MK7321W) with Multi Device which average does not use much. Read video reviews on how Logitech MK240 makes too much sound. Logitech Pebble 2 is a Price Point Vs Feature comparision to MK7321W. However i personally feal. Logitech keyboard round pebble design (basic version MK240) and flat Mouse Combo are too \"fancy\" round and flat contour mouse too stressful for hands not thought about designs.;It provides comfortable typing experience with responsive keys and a sleek design. Its wireless connection is stable and easy to set up,;good with work and easy to handle;Very good product, keys are very good and feels premium. Quality is also very good.

In terms of gaming performance, it falls far behind even an HP i3 7th gen laptop with 2GB AMD graphics. The sluggishness is unbearable, making gaming a frustrating experience rather than an enjoyable one.Compared to its competitors like the Acer Nitro series, this Dell laptop pales in comparison. The sluggish performance coupled with subpar graphics make it one of the worst gaming laptops I've encountered.What's worse, the laptop is already up for replacement from Dell, which speaks volumes about its reliability and build quality. Save yourself the headache and avoid this Dell gaming laptop at all costs. Invest your money in a better-performing and more reliable option elsewhere.;Good quality and good service;The best laptop I\u2019ve ever purchased. Don\u2019t expect a longer battery life; it\u2019s designed for power-hungry tasks, so it only lasts for 2 hours on a charge. However, I have no complaints about it. The other advantages outweigh this drawback. If you\u2019re seeking a powerful desktop replacement, this is the one to choose. If it can\u2019t satisfy you, no other laptop will.;I Don't feel it's overpriced because the service by dell deserve it. The laptops is awesome really the battery life is less still the other specs are very good. Steady build \ud83d\udcaa.

It offers good performance, a compact design, and a reasonable price. While it may not be the most powerful but it sulrely a  feature-rich laptop on the market, it's a great option for everyday tasks and casual users and students also;I purchased this product since the webcam of the last laptop i was using got spoilt. Though I felt this product was slightly on the expensive side, it gave me all the specs I was looking for. I loved the look and feel of this laptop and the performance so far has been pretty good. Just one observation.. I wanted to place a webcam protector/ slider cover, but so far, I'm unable to find any which fits due to the narrow borders.;Vey good laptop with high refresh rate and with a good user interface experience. If you are a student and a programmer i definitely would recommend this. If you are an editor you can have a look on this. Coming back to batter it last up to 3-4 hours which is okayish. Over all i would give 4.9/5 .#bestfromdell #amazingfromdell #dell;Writing review for Amazon service.Amazon has recently changed their policy with laptops, they don't allow you to return the product anymore.I had a really really bad experience with their service and even being a prime member didn't make any difference.so firstly the packaging was open, then laptop started behaving weirdly, I was seeing black screen at random while working on the laptop. Thirdly when I ran benchmark test software on the laptop I received it performed very poorly (24th percentile) when compared with same laptops around the globe (I suspected this when I observed that the laptop was performing slow & laggy)I first talked to DELL service centre, the told me that they don't replace laptops, thereafter, the amazon representative requested for a technician for me. First technician marked that the issue was resolved but actually it wasn't. So I had to request for an another technician. Second technician arrived and told me that he has reported the issue with the laptop and filed for a return from his side, but he actually marked the issue as resolved without filling any return. After that I waited for whole day waiting for Amazon representative but he didn't call even after assuring me that he takes full responsibility of my issue.So I had to call Amazon again, had to explain the whole thing again to 3 different Amazon representative. Again I got promised by an Amazon Representative that they will help me resolve the issue and call me back but NO ONE called.So I had to again call Amazon once again, had to explain the same thing again and now I am stuck because they don't send technician the third time and since both technicians have marked the issue as resolved Amazon has denied to help. So I am basically stuck with this laptop and have lost 65K just like that and laptop is of no use to me.I have ordered many times from Amazon but never have I expected that a brand which portrays itself to be consumer focused would do to someone who has been their user from a long time.;Worth purchase;Laptop recd before the committed time. As it is a new product, comenting on battery life is too early. Working on tally software is a tedious job as kayboard backlight is not working while working on tally and some other softwares. Touchpad is very sensetive and unnecessary opens other dialog boxes. Display screen goes beyond the laptop surface edges when open and every time there is a risk of damages of display's hinges.;Laptop is lightweight and excellent battery..but right speaker is making distorted sound;I am using this from last 20 days, after that I am reviewing it, it is super fast laptop, high performance, multi tasking, and most importantly Battery performance is at Best.I can do coding upto 7 hours after one charged .so all in all i found it very good product. I suggest that .",

Hope I will get one.;I am writing this review after almost 1.5 years of using the laptop.I had purchased this product in May 2023 from Amazon and this is what happened in August 2023, fortunately, the laptop was in the warranty period, so Dell team repaired it with no extra charges. However, I am facing similar issue again in September 2024. I believe, that the product's hardware quality is extremely low resulting in such damages.Battery drains very fast.You have to frequently keep updating the software/ internal programs or else they will malfunctionIn terms of other performance its good, it doesn't hang. but of you are looking for a durable laptop this is not the one to be chosen.Further up updating my review on 16 November 2024The same problem arised again and this the second time in 1.5 years that it has happened the same hinge and screen broke.Worst product;Worth full wonderful laptop n great deal;Laptop really good for smooth and speedy functions. Installed applications are working well. How ever there is no indication about the period of license available for  Microsoft Office etc. anywhere in the purchase details. This hidden details where one need to care at the time of buying;I have ordered this product in January 2023 during Amazon Sales but after the sale price was dropped. I don't know whom to blame for this price game Amazon or seller. This Laptop is not for gaming purpose however good enough for office purpose. MS Office some times get hanged. No backlit and No ethernet port is major drawback of the product. Dell should work on it.;So far so good;1 ghante use krte hi laptop band ho gya ... Pathetic quality... Delhi ke electronic market ke pc esse jyada chal jate hai ... Do not buy !",

The boot up time was 24 seconds. When fine tuned, it came down to 17 seconds. It came with a virus the moment I connected to internet, the windows defender found it and I got it quarantined. The battery was just lasting over 2 hours. While the specs look great on paper, the physical condition of keyboard was below par, with all the side keys on both sides suffering unremovable marks. The backlighting was also inconsistent. The webcam lens cover came off.;I was little hesitant to by refurbished laptop. Trust me, looks wise it is new. Performance wise it is excellent.

Es un producto muy recomendable y parece nuevo.;I've never purchased a refurbished computer before, so I wasn't entirely sure what sort of condition it would come in. I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised and satisfied. As an edition to my review, I must report that the only thing I'm not entirely happy about is that the battery life is short. I can write without a power connection for perhaps three hours. Besides that, the keyboard is clean and feels nice. It's a great layout, and all in all it's almost like having a new laptop, but at a great price. The seller promised to fix anything I wasn't happy about, and you can't get better than that. It seems to be fast and fully functional. I have the basic apps I was hoping for, so I don't have to go searching for them. The computer has a mic and a camera. I'm very pleased with the purchase.;It's an excellent laptop, all ports work as well as the screen and the camera; the charger that came with also works as expected. I have not had any issue using Wifi not Bluetooth. The USB-C port charges if you connect it to a charging device. I connected the laptop to a Dell WD 19 Docking Station connected to two screens via DisplayPort and it works smoothly when the laptop screen is open or closed.In the photos you can see that I maxed out the memory to 32GB RAM. On the other hand I haven't stressed out the device, because I have not an everyday software that forces me to do it. Because the lack of a powerful and independent video card, I don't think it will run any modern game, but it should handle, some office work like Matlab simulations or some streaming and video editing and other \"everyday\" software used by most people.I believe it's worth the cost.;the laptop is very slow, and it has minor scratches i wouldn\u2019t recommend this at all and plus the hdmi was not working;The laptop and everything arrived very quickly everything looks brand new. Turned the laptop on and got it started going through updates and everything. The charger didn't work but they're really cheap and I got two for $23 shipped just incase another goes out. The laptop is working great no issues with anything  also found out it has a touch screen which I either overlooked that part in the description or it's just standard on these either way that works good too. Highly recommend this laptop for anyone just trying to do simple work with it. Light weight so it's easy to take with you on the go. The storage is enough for your needs I added a external 4 TB Hard drive for all my pictures and videos. All in all it works great order an extra charger with it just incase they go bad after awhile anyways.",

I primarily use this laptop for trading, watching movies, and general productivity tasks, and it has proven to be more than capable for all my needs.**Performance and Display:**Equipped with an Intel 12th Gen Core i3 processor and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop delivers smooth and responsive performance, even when multitasking between multiple applications. The 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a stunning visual experience, making movies come to life and enhancing the fluidity of my trading charts.**Portability and Build Quality:**Weighing just 1.69kg and featuring a thin and lightweight design, the Dell 15 is easy to carry around, whether I'm working from home or on the go. The spill-resistant keyboard adds a layer of durability, giving me peace of mind against accidental spills during long trading sessions or movie marathons.**Value for Money:**At a price of 29k, this laptop offers exceptional value for money. With its solid performance, vibrant display, and practical features, it competes favorably with higher-priced alternatives on the market. For a first-time laptop buyer like myself, it's reassuring to know that I've made a wise investment in a reliable and versatile computing device.**Future Updates:**I plan to update this review after six months of using the Dell 15, providing valuable insights into its long-term performance, durability, and any additional features or drawbacks I may discover over time. This will be helpful for others who are considering purchasing the same laptop and are looking for real-world experiences.**Final Thoughts:**Overall, the Dell 15 has been an outstanding first laptop for me. Its combination of performance, display quality, portability, and affordability makes it an ideal choice for users looking for a versatile companion for everyday computing tasks. Whether you're a student, professional, or casual user, the Dell 15 delivers a compelling user experience that punches above its price point. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for their first laptop or a reliable upgrade.Edit: today 7 September 2024 my hinges broked but because of dell service they replaced my hinges and laptop upper body \ud83d\udc45 , Hinges were hard and after replacement they're very smooth like Amul butter. Zero rupees replacement! Just call customer care and told everything! Within 2 days engineer visit and fixed it!, check my images and videos.Overall laptop is great \ud83d\ude38! I bought this laptop only 29k because of credit card discount..;I ordered this laptop and I had received old and used laptop in open box. Orignal box was open which was kept inside good amazon outer box, so I couldn't check open box while taking laptop delivery. See below issues that I faced and need your attention so that you save your money.Open box, used laptopI order 14\" laptop and received 15.9\" display.It was getting Heat too much in this cold winter weather.When pressed power switch thrice it turns on.Some times there is black screen and only cursor visible. Twice it happened.Faulty product, was looking like refurbished computer.This seller is selling faulty product. Be aware. It's good to buy from local shop.Configuration is same as described.There are 21% , 1star review;Over all good product, Battery exhaust fast.;The media could not be loaded.It Is Very Ideal For Work And Without Lagging. Very Handy To Use, Feels Like A Book & Is Light. Very Clear Display. Very Satisfied From Amazon. We Were Initially Worried About Quality But It Is The Best By Value.You Can Go For It For Office Working. Used For 4 Hours 100% to 15% In Full Use.;Received my system on 27th February, Completed system configuration, yet to start using.Positive - Received in company (Dell) packing, and Amazon box on top of it, lot of protection inside, brand new piece, verily slim look \u2026 Overall look and feel is Brilliant\u2026Shall write more about performance once I start using itThanks everyone for your attention;I purchased this laptop on the 18th and today is the 24th. I have read a lot of reviews complaining about heating issues and yes they are right. This laptop is a heater. It will be very helpful during the winter season.But I am keeping this as I have liked it and that's why the good 3 stars I am giving.When you use any laptop for the first few days, it heats up pretty badly because of a lot of updates going on in the background. I was almost scared when I see it heats up super bad and was thinking to return it. But that was just one time. But still, it heats up more than a normal laptop should. I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work. I just purchased it as a backup laptop because my main laptop Asus Vivobook runs 14 to 18hrs a day for the last 5 yrs and it needs some rest.Personally, I won't recommend this laptop. Maybe try Asus or HP. Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though. Will update after 4-5 months of usage and re-write proper review after 1 year of usageEdit: 21st August 2024.Well, on 14th August, 2024, laptop stopped working. I sent it to Dell repair and found motherboard is dead. They need to replace it whole.So I am not recommending this laptop. People say right. Never bought expensive stuffs online. This is 4th laptop and 1st online and so huge issue. Motherboard estimation is 16500 right now. Luckily I have insurance, I am not sure how much will they cover. My Asus, HP, Compaq and Macbook never got motherboard issue and all lasted long. This one gave so big issues even from start and now look at it.",

                "text": "I recently purchased the Dell 15 Thin & Light Laptop, and so far, I'm quite impressed. It packs a Core i5-1235U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, which makes multitasking smooth and quick. The 15.6\" FHD display is sharp and offers great visuals whether I'm streaming videos or working on documents.What stands out for me is how lightweight it is\u2014just 1.66kg\u2014making it super portable without feeling flimsy. Despite its slim design, the laptop feels sturdy, and the spill-resistant keyboard is a nice touch for added peace of mind.Another bonus is the pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office 2021, so I was ready to work right out of the box. The inclusion of 15 months of McAfee security is a nice plus, especially if you're cautious about online threats.If I had to nitpick, 8GB of RAM is decent for everyday tasks but may not be enough for more intensive work or gaming. Also, the build, while durable, does attract fingerprints, especially on the black finish.Overall, this is an excellent laptop for students, professionals, or anyone needing a reliable machine for daily use without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for its performance, portability, and value!;As soon as the 1year warranty period is over the laptop stopped working. It gets hanged or dropped out when I'm in a meeting. Also it gets hanged when I'm trying to open an excell or any file. I've been trying to reach the customer support as well but they don't take you call or respond to message. Worst customer service and worst product. Please don't buy it.;;Worth buying this, thx.;Fear that...it may blast;nice;I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare. Right out of the box, there was a glaring green dot on the screen that refuses to go away, and the camera is unstable, making it impossible to use for work or meetings.I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to help. When I contacted Dell, their so-called \"support\" team told me they could only replace the LED/ED screen and couldn\u2019t even provide me with a DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter. How does that even make sense for a brand-new product?I trusted Amazon and Dell to deliver a quality product and back it up with proper service, but I\u2019ve been left stuck in the middle with no solution. Both companies are shirking their responsibilities, and now I\u2019m stuck with a defective laptop.This is unacceptable from two major companies that are supposed to be industry leaders. I will think twice before purchasing anything from Amazon or Dell again. Buyers beware! Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.;light weight, good portability, decent looks , good built quality, battery lasts 5-6 hrs for normal use , lasts 8 hrs on battery saver mode if you do light works .  All well except one  issue that is it starts lagging /stuttering, videos get hung if you use the laptop while charging due to overheating . But this problem is solved by using better cooling solution like using laptop bottom riser while charging. Dont forget to buy a laptop riser along with this product.",

The second one is working great, too.Note: 4 of the 6 USB ports were not working. I changed settings of all USB hubs and root hubs to \"disable the powering off of USB ports\" (basically, unchecked the relevant setting) and all 6 ports are operational perfectly.I wish to add that I bought several renewed products like Mobile Phones, Tablets and Desktops from Amazon and all worked great !! (Except renewed hard drives). I wish to thank Amazon for this renewed/refurbished initiative. It saves good chunk of money and minimizes e-waste.Please read original product review, as below:Pros:* Looks really like a new desktop* Configuration is exactly as per Amazon Webpage* Seller Hi Laptops Desktops have taken a lot of efforts to give a pleasing experience on Powering Up the Unit. Amazing. Never seen anything like that before.* Very compact cabinet. I can carry it with me to any other place easily.* Speed and Performance as expected from the configuration which I bought.* Driver CD smartly placed inside the DVD Writer, when shipped.* Received WiFi Adapter, which is a bonus and pleasant surprise.* Silent. No fan noises.* Best thing is worked directly out-of-box. Absolutely no hassles.* Packing was OUTSTANDING !!!!! It came 100% safe from Hyderabad (shipping place) to Mumbai. Arrived before time.* Online warranty registration was smooth and easy and happened in first go.Cons:To be frank and honest, there are NO cons. Dear Hi Laptops Desktops Seller and New Jaisa (probably the manufacturer/refurbisher) both have done excellent job.Conclusion: Go ahead with this Seller. No need to worry. You will get a good machine in economical rate.;System on and off continuously.. Not booting... Specification not matching as per your order details... System pics mismatch.. Vga port dead... Front panel loose shaking.. Packing not good and safe... Only taped.. Not a good product from recyclekart.. Product is very small when compared to pics.. Better avoid. . . Returned it for refund.... Only refund....supplier don't have replacement stock also...what criteria does Amazon follow to rate the  seller rating.. If repeated complaints why seller is found in your Amazon shopping list.. To waste your resources as well as customer time and energy...15days wasted wait ing.....;Cpu good working. Looking new. All ficher and deta perfect. Thank you Amazon.;CPU is in very good condition. Using it for more than a week and it's working perfectly fine. Product is under 6 months warranty so, no need to worry at all. One of the best thing is that Wifi dongle was also included which I liked most. Core i5 3.2 GHz, 8GB RAM, 500 GB HDD, MS Office in just \u20b96300 is definitely a value for money deal.Anyone looking for value buy, should definitely go for it. #NayaJaisa;Bad products got in working condition but faulty afterwards and they say you have to ship to their address costed 700 for courier then also after repair worked for two days then stopped working;Product failed with in 4months of purchase, but replaced by newjaisa technologies another same product, over all feedback is satisfactory.;CPU is in very good condition and it's working perfectly fine. Product is under 6 months warranty so, no need to worry at all. One of the best thing is that Wifi dongle was also included which I liked most. Core i5 3.2 GHz, 8GB RAM, 500 GB HDD, MS Office in just \u20b96300 is definitely a value for money deal.;Worst product, performence is very low and now it is not working.. Not even used 50 hours after bought this product in 3 monts. Now it is not working. Support team is not responding properly.. They are doing time pass with customers instead of providing support. I raised request 3 days back  but no proper response. Waste of money and time .Several times given complaint as system is not working but no one is not responding. I dont know why amazon allowing these kind of fake sellars to sell products on amazon.",

But keyboard smoothness and sturdiness are class.... Worth the money.;Overall quality and softness of the keyboard is awesome.;Spilt water accidently on keyboard and it started malfunctioning altough it says \"Splash Resistant Keys\". Maybe a gimmick to lure customers. Also, the customer care/after sales is not available and mailed are not addressed to properly by Dell.;Posting this for someone who wants to buy and looking for reviews / comparision, which i did not find before buying. Comparing Dell and Logitech because they are best brands. And everytime it is Pricepoint you want to pay for value delivered by any brand or product within brand.First for Dell. Dell MK5221W I bought this as it is midway between features Vs Price Point MK235 (Basic) and MK7321W. Advanced MK7321W has Features like 1. \"Muti Device\" Combo used across mutiple Device like Windows, Apple system with click of button with Bluetooth5.0 and 2. \"Universal Pairing\" use wireless+mouse across multiple devices by changing remote \"Universal non-systrm specific Programmable\" USB Dongle) and 3. Programmable 12 Keyboard keys + 3 Mouse Rolling Wheel keys ( left Tilt + Right LTilt not found in basic + Centre Click). Dell MK5221W gives midway features with \"Universal Pairing\" + \"Programmable Keyboard 12 keys + Mouse Roll Wheel Tilt (only left + Center key, Not found in basic). Please Google on wireless keybaord / mouse \"Muti Device\" or \"Universal Pairing\" to know more on features to understand what you want to pay for.Next on Logitech MK240 (Logitech very cheap version of Dell MK7321W) with Multi Device which average does not use much. Read video reviews on how Logitech MK240 makes too much sound. Logitech Pebble 2 is a Price Point Vs Feature comparision to MK7321W. However i personally feal. Logitech keyboard round pebble design (basic version MK240) and flat Mouse Combo are too \"fancy\" round and flat contour mouse too stressful for hands not thought about designs.;It provides comfortable typing experience with responsive keys and a sleek design. Its wireless connection is stable and easy to set up,;good with work and easy to handle;Very good product, keys are very good and feels premium. Quality is also very good. Using for last 4 months no sich issues.",

                "text": "Good product as it\u2019s working well;Cheated by the supplier, I'm writing my review after using the product for three months. Within one month, I noticed it was a painted laptop, and the paint started fading. After some time, the battery showed as fully charged but drained in seconds. Now, the battery has started swelling, and the laptop has finally stopped working. Do not buy this product from this supplier. I felt cheated. and deceived, and I believe it's only fair to share my experience with others who may be considering this purchase. The initial excitement of acquiring what seemed like a high-quality laptop quickly turned into frustration and disappointment. It's unacceptable for any company to sell products that do not live up to their promises, especially when they put customers' safety at risk with issues like battery swelling. I urge potential buyers to conduct thorough research before making a decision. Look for reviews from other customers and consider purchasing from reputable suppliers who stand behind their products. Investing in a reliable laptop is essential, especially if it\u2019s intended for work or personal use. My hope is that by sharing my story, I can save someone else from going through the same ordeal I experienced. Protect your hard-earned money and choose wisely\u2014there are much better options available out there!;I bought this laptop - Dell Latitude 5490 Business 7th Gen Laptop PC (Intel Core i5-7300U, 8GB Ram, 256GB SSD) with Win 10 Pro, but it came with Windows 11 Home, which is OK. I bought it for limited home use mostly for browsing, documentations, etc., with some gaming, but not dedicated gaming. I have experience of buying refurbished laptop at dirt cheep price in the past and so I bought this refurbished laptop, but this doesn't look like a refurbished one at all. Its just like a new one, no scratches, no marks. Everything is working fine as of now. Also got a copy of Microsoft Office with this laptop without extra cost. Recommended, if you need a laptop for limited home use like mine.;Working Fine for now, except backside of hinges paint has gone.;I'm using this laptop from last 20days . It has good battery life. Performance is like new , doesn't feel it's refurbished at all. Affordable laptop for those who are buying for work. Good for it \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\u2705Current update:After using this laptop for 6month my ssd stop working and I got an exchange of the ssd from the seller. Which is not working as well and no other shop is not taking this laptop to fix my issue. If you're investing 19k I'll suggest buy a new one. Cause my laptop is no longer usable. I have to throw it. And I'm a student and I can't afford for temporary use. Such a waste.;I purchased this product a few months back. I highly recommend if you are looking for refurbised laptos. Lately i have tiny issue with the battery but as it is a refurbised product its reasonable.;I am using this laptop for only few days. It is working alright. Battery backup is good. Speed is good. I am giving 3 star because the laptop is broken at the bottom but I can adjust.;Extremely nice product condition. Had a great experience using the laptop for my daily work with great efficiency without any heating problem. Battery gets dropped but it's manageable slightest thing. Everything is great with product so far go for it if you're purchasing.!!;Great value for the price, function well so far, look nice size just right no issue so far;The laptop came with a virus. A severe threat according to Windows Security;Awesome product and services.;Could not connect to my wired network, but WiFi worked fine, so not a big deal to me.  Everything else seemed to work OK;Bought this for my daughter who is in HS. It is very responsive and was exactly what we were looking for at a great price",

I got it for 57k in dec 2024.Size is little bit small.Keyboard feels nice to type, UI is also very smooth to use, speaker quality and display is awesome, Battery backup is mind-blowing, it will easily last you for two days under normal use , performance is also very good.It has strong alluminium body which is very sturdy, you can also open it with one hand.Functionality wise I would say little bit poor because it only has 2 usb c port and one headphone jack that's it.;The Apple MacBook Air M1 is an absolute game-changer. From performance to battery life, this laptop excels in every category. Powered by the M1 chip, it delivers lightning-fast processing speeds, whether you're multitasking with several apps or handling more intensive tasks like video editing. The fanless design ensures it runs silently, making it perfect for quiet environments like libraries or meetings.The battery life is phenomenal, lasting over 15 hours on a single charge, which makes it incredibly reliable for long workdays or travel. The Retina display is crisp, vibrant, and sharp, offering stunning visuals for creative work and media consumption. Plus, the build quality is top-notch, featuring Apple's signature sleek and lightweight design.What stands out the most is how smoothly macOS Big Sur operates on the M1 chip. Apps open instantly, and the overall user experience feels fluid and seamless. Even legacy apps that run through Rosetta 2 show no lag, making this an easy transition from Intel-based Macs.For anyone looking for an ultra-portable, powerful, and efficient laptop, the MacBook Air M1 is unbeatable. I highly recommend it for professionals, students, or casual users alike. Five stars all the way!;I got this beautiful machine during Great Indian Festival at a good price.Thanks to Amazon.Its full metal body,light weight,slim,beautiful,fast,long battery life(14-15 hrs),the stereo speakers are loud and breeze to ears.The performance of M1 chip surpasses many windows based processors.Its brightness is sufficient for indoor and outdoor.I have uninstalled some pre installed softwares like imovie,garage band.By uninstalling these 2 you can free around 4 GB of space.If you are new to MAC os then it will take couple of days to adapt.I will recommend to purchase one antivirus for your new mac.Just make sure you are purchasing the right product,if you purchase windows compatible antivirus it won't work in Mac.I have purchased Bitdefender Antivirus for MAC and it is working fine.Apart from this you can find excel,word,power point in app store free of cost.Alternatively you can also install wps office for your word and excel requirement.Overall i will rate 5 star to Mac M1.;The Apple MacBook Air with M1 chip is fast, efficient, and ideal for everyday tasks and light creative work.

                "text": "This is another Mini PC (aka 1-Litre PC) that we bought for use in our Conference Room, but had to assign to a user. The assigned users work in our Warehouse Office and this computer is On for 12 - 14 hours every day, 6 days of the week. It has been working flawlessly so far with no complains of noise-heat or slowdown. Compared to the Dell's Small Form Factor (SFF) PCs, the Mini PCs are a better deal. They feature CPUs that are identical but thanks to external power adapters, they are far more serviceable. The SFF PCs have internal SMPS that are unique to Dell and the repair facilities near my office are unable to repair them due to unavailability of specific components. The external adapters used by these Mini PCs is a standard part that is also used by Dell Laptops and hence easy to replace.;The product came as it was . It worked fine on the first but from the second day it did not start and started making beep sound . Overall the product is worst \ud83d\ude15 .;Using this to host my server for personal use. It has been a good ride for now with no crashes or glitches. The machine is capable for what I have thrown at it, but it is an older machine and you may find it lacking in a lot of areas ex: playing 4K videos, CPU intensive services. I would recommend going for a 7th Gen chip if you can afford it. But if not, this will do nicely too.For anyone looking to buy this to run a self hosted server, few points to note:1. 6th processors do not fully support 10 bit HEVC so if you have a lot of HEVC media; might want to look into pre-transcoding and then serving. I am able to play 10 bit HEVC 1080p, 4K is unplayable.2. Best to get a debian / ubuntu server running baremetal or proxmox if you feel like it. I myself am running Ubuntu server. Windows 11 is absolutely ass to run on this hardware plus I'm not too confident of the install that came with it.3. Change the internal storage as soon as possible, the drive it comes bundled with is not reputed and can fail, YMMV.4. Please use ethernet, do not use the wifi dongle provided with it.;Good packing and specs as mentioned. Only downside was not having wifi. PC is fast and fully satisfied.;The desktop was received in good condition.  Of course, you can figure that its not brand new - but it didn't have any scratches or any dents.  It didn't look battered or abused.  It just looked slightly used.As soon as the hardware was received; I tested what came out of the box.  Tested memory, hard disk capacity, USB points and their speeds.  Everything was as promised.  Even though, the description said it comes with Windows 10, the desktop I received was already upgraded to Win 11.  The content of the disk / windows installation was in virgin state.  The disk contained installable of MS office (but not actually installed).I could install PROXMOX hypervisor on the device (you have to enable legacy boot for booting into PROXMOX installer).  After a couple of weeks, I can say - all is well and the system is working very well.  Recommended.;Product discription is different and product is different in not comes with Inbuit WIFI and Bluetooth Adapter but its all given in the discription the seller accepted to se the dongle to you if you ask for this issue but you will never receive the same..i have writen on seller feedback also but there is no responce from seller and amazon size so kindly think twice befor purchase..;SSD drive failed after a month of usage. Had to replace it. working good otherwise;Gr8 pc for price",

I primarily use this laptop for trading, watching movies, and general productivity tasks, and it has proven to be more than capable for all my needs.**Performance and Display:**Equipped with an Intel 12th Gen Core i3 processor and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop delivers smooth and responsive performance, even when multitasking between multiple applications. The 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a stunning visual experience, making movies come to life and enhancing the fluidity of my trading charts.**Portability and Build Quality:**Weighing just 1.69kg and featuring a thin and lightweight design, the Dell 15 is easy to carry around, whether I'm working from home or on the go. The spill-resistant keyboard adds a layer of durability, giving me peace of mind against accidental spills during long trading sessions or movie marathons.**Value for Money:**At a price of 29k, this laptop offers exceptional value for money. With its solid performance, vibrant display, and practical features, it competes favorably with higher-priced alternatives on the market. For a first-time laptop buyer like myself, it's reassuring to know that I've made a wise investment in a reliable and versatile computing device.**Future Updates:**I plan to update this review after six months of using the Dell 15, providing valuable insights into its long-term performance, durability, and any additional features or drawbacks I may discover over time. This will be helpful for others who are considering purchasing the same laptop and are looking for real-world experiences.**Final Thoughts:**Overall, the Dell 15 has been an outstanding first laptop for me. Its combination of performance, display quality, portability, and affordability makes it an ideal choice for users looking for a versatile companion for everyday computing tasks. Whether you're a student, professional, or casual user, the Dell 15 delivers a compelling user experience that punches above its price point. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for their first laptop or a reliable upgrade.Edit: today 7 September 2024 my hinges broked but because of dell service they replaced my hinges and laptop upper body \ud83d\udc45 , Hinges were hard and after replacement they're very smooth like Amul butter. Zero rupees replacement! Just call customer care and told everything! Within 2 days engineer visit and fixed it!, check my images and videos.Overall laptop is great \ud83d\ude38! I bought this laptop only 29k because of credit card discount..;I ordered this laptop and I had received old and used laptop in open box. Orignal box was open which was kept inside good amazon outer box, so I couldn't check open box while taking laptop delivery. See below issues that I faced and need your attention so that you save your money.Open box, used laptopI order 14\" laptop and received 15.9\" display.It was getting Heat too much in this cold winter weather.When pressed power switch thrice it turns on.Some times there is black screen and only cursor visible. Twice it happened.Faulty product, was looking like refurbished computer.This seller is selling faulty product. Be aware. It's good to buy from local shop.Configuration is same as described.There are 21% , 1star review;Over all good product, Battery exhaust fast.;The media could not be loaded.It Is Very Ideal For Work And Without Lagging. Very Handy To Use, Feels Like A Book & Is Light. Very Clear Display. Very Satisfied From Amazon. We Were Initially Worried About Quality But It Is The Best By Value.You Can Go For It For Office Working. Used For 4 Hours 100% to 15% In Full Use.;Received my system on 27th February, Completed system configuration, yet to start using.Positive - Received in company (Dell) packing, and Amazon box on top of it, lot of protection inside, brand new piece, verily slim look \u2026 Overall look and feel is Brilliant\u2026Shall write more about performance once I start using itThanks everyone for your attention;I purchased this laptop on the 18th and today is the 24th. I have read a lot of reviews complaining about heating issues and yes they are right. This laptop is a heater. It will be very helpful during the winter season.But I am keeping this as I have liked it and that's why the good 3 stars I am giving.When you use any laptop for the first few days, it heats up pretty badly because of a lot of updates going on in the background. I was almost scared when I see it heats up super bad and was thinking to return it. But that was just one time. But still, it heats up more than a normal laptop should. I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work. I just purchased it as a backup laptop because my main laptop Asus Vivobook runs 14 to 18hrs a day for the last 5 yrs and it needs some rest.Personally, I won't recommend this laptop. Maybe try Asus or HP. Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though. Will update after 4-5 months of usage and re-write proper review after 1 year of usageEdit: 21st August 2024.Well, on 14th August, 2024, laptop stopped working. I sent it to Dell repair and found motherboard is dead. They need to replace it whole.So I am not recommending this laptop. People say right. Never bought expensive stuffs online. This is 4th laptop and 1st online and so huge issue. Motherboard estimation is 16500 right now. Luckily I have insurance, I am not sure how much will they cover. My Asus, HP, Compaq and Macbook never got motherboard issue and all lasted long. This one gave so big issues even from start and now look at it.",

                "text": "I recently purchased the Dell 15 Thin & Light Laptop, and so far, I'm quite impressed. It packs a Core i5-1235U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, which makes multitasking smooth and quick. The 15.6\" FHD display is sharp and offers great visuals whether I'm streaming videos or working on documents.What stands out for me is how lightweight it is\u2014just 1.66kg\u2014making it super portable without feeling flimsy. Despite its slim design, the laptop feels sturdy, and the spill-resistant keyboard is a nice touch for added peace of mind.Another bonus is the pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office 2021, so I was ready to work right out of the box. The inclusion of 15 months of McAfee security is a nice plus, especially if you're cautious about online threats.If I had to nitpick, 8GB of RAM is decent for everyday tasks but may not be enough for more intensive work or gaming. Also, the build, while durable, does attract fingerprints, especially on the black finish.Overall, this is an excellent laptop for students, professionals, or anyone needing a reliable machine for daily use without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for its performance, portability, and value!;As soon as the 1year warranty period is over the laptop stopped working. It gets hanged or dropped out when I'm in a meeting. Also it gets hanged when I'm trying to open an excell or any file. I've been trying to reach the customer support as well but they don't take you call or respond to message. Worst customer service and worst product. Please don't buy it.;;Worth buying this, thx.;Fear that...it may blast;nice;I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare. Right out of the box, there was a glaring green dot on the screen that refuses to go away, and the camera is unstable, making it impossible to use for work or meetings.I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to help. When I contacted Dell, their so-called \"support\" team told me they could only replace the LED/ED screen and couldn\u2019t even provide me with a DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter. How does that even make sense for a brand-new product?I trusted Amazon and Dell to deliver a quality product and back it up with proper service, but I\u2019ve been left stuck in the middle with no solution. Both companies are shirking their responsibilities, and now I\u2019m stuck with a defective laptop.This is unacceptable from two major companies that are supposed to be industry leaders. I will think twice before purchasing anything from Amazon or Dell again. Buyers beware! Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.;light weight, good portability, decent looks , good built quality, battery lasts 5-6 hrs for normal use , lasts 8 hrs on battery saver mode if you do light works .  All well except one  issue that is it starts lagging /stuttering, videos get hung if you use the laptop while charging due to overheating . But this problem is solved by using better cooling solution like using laptop bottom riser while charging. Dont forget to buy a laptop riser along with this product.",

                "text": "This is another Mini PC (aka 1-Litre PC) that we bought for use in our Conference Room, but had to assign to a user. The assigned users work in our Warehouse Office and this computer is On for 12 - 14 hours every day, 6 days of the week. It has been working flawlessly so far with no complains of noise-heat or slowdown. Compared to the Dell's Small Form Factor (SFF) PCs, the Mini PCs are a better deal. They feature CPUs that are identical but thanks to external power adapters, they are far more serviceable. The SFF PCs have internal SMPS that are unique to Dell and the repair facilities near my office are unable to repair them due to unavailability of specific components. The external adapters used by these Mini PCs is a standard part that is also used by Dell Laptops and hence easy to replace.;The product came as it was . It worked fine on the first but from the second day it did not start and started making beep sound . Overall the product is worst \ud83d\ude15 .;Using this to host my server for personal use. It has been a good ride for now with no crashes or glitches. The machine is capable for what I have thrown at it, but it is an older machine and you may find it lacking in a lot of areas ex: playing 4K videos, CPU intensive services. I would recommend going for a 7th Gen chip if you can afford it. But if not, this will do nicely too.For anyone looking to buy this to run a self hosted server, few points to note:1. 6th processors do not fully support 10 bit HEVC so if you have a lot of HEVC media; might want to look into pre-transcoding and then serving. I am able to play 10 bit HEVC 1080p, 4K is unplayable.2. Best to get a debian / ubuntu server running baremetal or proxmox if you feel like it. I myself am running Ubuntu server. Windows 11 is absolutely ass to run on this hardware plus I'm not too confident of the install that came with it.3. Change the internal storage as soon as possible, the drive it comes bundled with is not reputed and can fail, YMMV.4. Please use ethernet, do not use the wifi dongle provided with it.;Good packing and specs as mentioned. Only downside was not having wifi. PC is fast and fully satisfied.;The desktop was received in good condition.  Of course, you can figure that its not brand new - but it didn't have any scratches or any dents.  It didn't look battered or abused.  It just looked slightly used.As soon as the hardware was received; I tested what came out of the box.  Tested memory, hard disk capacity, USB points and their speeds.  Everything was as promised.  Even though, the description said it comes with Windows 10, the desktop I received was already upgraded to Win 11.  The content of the disk / windows installation was in virgin state.  The disk contained installable of MS office (but not actually installed).I could install PROXMOX hypervisor on the device (you have to enable legacy boot for booting into PROXMOX installer).  After a couple of weeks, I can say - all is well and the system is working very well.  Recommended.;Product discription is different and product is different in not comes with Inbuit WIFI and Bluetooth Adapter but its all given in the discription the seller accepted to se the dongle to you if you ask for this issue but you will never receive the same..i have writen on seller feedback also but there is no responce from seller and amazon size so kindly think twice befor purchase..;SSD drive failed after a month of usage. Had to replace it. working good otherwise;Gr8 pc for price",

From performance to battery life, this laptop excels in every category. Powered by the M1 chip, it delivers lightning-fast processing speeds, whether you're multitasking with several apps or handling more intensive tasks like video editing. The fanless design ensures it runs silently, making it perfect for quiet environments like libraries or meetings.The battery life is phenomenal, lasting over 15 hours on a single charge, which makes it incredibly reliable for long workdays or travel. The Retina display is crisp, vibrant, and sharp, offering stunning visuals for creative work and media consumption. Plus, the build quality is top-notch, featuring Apple's signature sleek and lightweight design.What stands out the most is how smoothly macOS Big Sur operates on the M1 chip. Apps open instantly, and the overall user experience feels fluid and seamless.

It offers good performance, a compact design, and a reasonable price. While it may not be the most powerful but it sulrely a  feature-rich laptop on the market, it's a great option for everyday tasks and casual users and students also;I purchased this product since the webcam of the last laptop i was using got spoilt. Though I felt this product was slightly on the expensive side, it gave me all the specs I was looking for. I loved the look and feel of this laptop and the performance so far has been pretty good. Just one observation.. I wanted to place a webcam protector/ slider cover, but so far, I'm unable to find any which fits due to the narrow borders.;Vey good laptop with high refresh rate and with a good user interface experience. If you are a student and a programmer i definitely would recommend this. If you are an editor you can have a look on this. Coming back to batter it last up to 3-4 hours which is okayish. Over all i would give 4.9/5 .#bestfromdell #amazingfromdell #dell;Writing review for Amazon service.Amazon has recently changed their policy with laptops, they don't allow you to return the product anymore.I had a really really bad experience with their service and even being a prime member didn't make any difference.so firstly the packaging was open, then laptop started behaving weirdly, I was seeing black screen at random while working on the laptop. Thirdly when I ran benchmark test software on the laptop I received it performed very poorly (24th percentile) when compared with same laptops around the globe (I suspected this when I observed that the laptop was performing slow & laggy)I first talked to DELL service centre, the told me that they don't replace laptops, thereafter, the amazon representative requested for a technician for me. First technician marked that the issue was resolved but actually it wasn't. So I had to request for an another technician. Second technician arrived and told me that he has reported the issue with the laptop and filed for a return from his side, but he actually marked the issue as resolved without filling any return. After that I waited for whole day waiting for Amazon representative but he didn't call even after assuring me that he takes full responsibility of my issue.So I had to call Amazon again, had to explain the whole thing again to 3 different Amazon representative. Again I got promised by an Amazon Representative that they will help me resolve the issue and call me back but NO ONE called.So I had to again call Amazon once again, had to explain the same thing again and now I am stuck because they don't send technician the third time and since both technicians have marked the issue as resolved Amazon has denied to help. So I am basically stuck with this laptop and have lost 65K just like that and laptop is of no use to me.I have ordered many times from Amazon but never have I expected that a brand which portrays itself to be consumer focused would do to someone who has been their user from a long time.;Worth purchase;Laptop recd before the committed time. As it is a new product, comenting on battery life is too early. Working on tally software is a tedious job as kayboard backlight is not working while working on tally and some other softwares. Touchpad is very sensetive and unnecessary opens other dialog boxes. Display screen goes beyond the laptop surface edges when open and every time there is a risk of damages of display's hinges.;Laptop is lightweight and excellent battery..but right speaker is making distorted sound;I am using this from last 20 days, after that I am reviewing it, it is super fast laptop, high performance, multi tasking, and most importantly Battery performance is at Best.I can do coding upto 7 hours after one charged .so all in all i found it very good product. I suggest that .",

I primarily use this laptop for trading, watching movies, and general productivity tasks, and it has proven to be more than capable for all my needs.**Performance and Display:**Equipped with an Intel 12th Gen Core i3 processor and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop delivers smooth and responsive performance, even when multitasking between multiple applications. The 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a stunning visual experience, making movies come to life and enhancing the fluidity of my trading charts.**Portability and Build Quality:**Weighing just 1.69kg and featuring a thin and lightweight design, the Dell 15 is easy to carry around, whether I'm working from home or on the go. The spill-resistant keyboard adds a layer of durability, giving me peace of mind against accidental spills during long trading sessions or movie marathons.**Value for Money:**At a price of 29k, this laptop offers exceptional value for money. With its solid performance, vibrant display, and practical features, it competes favorably with higher-priced alternatives on the market. For a first-time laptop buyer like myself, it's reassuring to know that I've made a wise investment in a reliable and versatile computing device.**Future Updates:**I plan to update this review after six months of using the Dell 15, providing valuable insights into its long-term performance, durability, and any additional features or drawbacks I may discover over time. This will be helpful for others who are considering purchasing the same laptop and are looking for real-world experiences.**Final Thoughts:**Overall, the Dell 15 has been an outstanding first laptop for me. Its combination of performance, display quality, portability, and affordability makes it an ideal choice for users looking for a versatile companion for everyday computing tasks. Whether you're a student, professional, or casual user, the Dell 15 delivers a compelling user experience that punches above its price point. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for their first laptop or a reliable upgrade.Edit: today 7 September 2024 my hinges broked but because of dell service they replaced my hinges and laptop upper body \ud83d\udc45 , Hinges were hard and after replacement they're very smooth like Amul butter. Zero rupees replacement! Just call customer care and told everything! Within 2 days engineer visit and fixed it!, check my images and videos.Overall laptop is great \ud83d\ude38! I bought this laptop only 29k because of credit card discount..;I ordered this laptop and I had received old and used laptop in open box. Orignal box was open which was kept inside good amazon outer box, so I couldn't check open box while taking laptop delivery. See below issues that I faced and need your attention so that you save your money.Open box, used laptopI order 14\" laptop and received 15.9\" display.It was getting Heat too much in this cold winter weather.When pressed power switch thrice it turns on.Some times there is black screen and only cursor visible. Twice it happened.Faulty product, was looking like refurbished computer.This seller is selling faulty product. Be aware. It's good to buy from local shop.Configuration is same as described.There are 21% , 1star review;Over all good product, Battery exhaust fast.;The media could not be loaded.It Is Very Ideal For Work And Without Lagging. Very Handy To Use, Feels Like A Book & Is Light. Very Clear Display. Very Satisfied From Amazon. We Were Initially Worried About Quality But It Is The Best By Value.You Can Go For It For Office Working. Used For 4 Hours 100% to 15% In Full Use.;Received my system on 27th February, Completed system configuration, yet to start using.Positive - Received in company (Dell) packing, and Amazon box on top of it, lot of protection inside, brand new piece, verily slim look \u2026 Overall look and feel is Brilliant\u2026Shall write more about performance once I start using itThanks everyone for your attention;I purchased this laptop on the 18th and today is the 24th. I have read a lot of reviews complaining about heating issues and yes they are right. This laptop is a heater. It will be very helpful during the winter season.But I am keeping this as I have liked it and that's why the good 3 stars I am giving.When you use any laptop for the first few days, it heats up pretty badly because of a lot of updates going on in the background. I was almost scared when I see it heats up super bad and was thinking to return it. But that was just one time. But still, it heats up more than a normal laptop should. I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work. I just purchased it as a backup laptop because my main laptop Asus Vivobook runs 14 to 18hrs a day for the last 5 yrs and it needs some rest.Personally, I won't recommend this laptop. Maybe try Asus or HP. Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though. Will update after 4-5 months of usage and re-write proper review after 1 year of usageEdit: 21st August 2024.Well, on 14th August, 2024, laptop stopped working. I sent it to Dell repair and found motherboard is dead. They need to replace it whole.So I am not recommending this laptop. People say right. Never bought expensive stuffs online. This is 4th laptop and 1st online and so huge issue. Motherboard estimation is 16500 right now. Luckily I have insurance, I am not sure how much will they cover. My Asus, HP, Compaq and Macbook never got motherboard issue and all lasted long. This one gave so big issues even from start and now look at it.",

                "text": "I recently purchased the Dell 15 Thin & Light Laptop, and so far, I'm quite impressed. It packs a Core i5-1235U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, which makes multitasking smooth and quick. The 15.6\" FHD display is sharp and offers great visuals whether I'm streaming videos or working on documents.What stands out for me is how lightweight it is\u2014just 1.66kg\u2014making it super portable without feeling flimsy. Despite its slim design, the laptop feels sturdy, and the spill-resistant keyboard is a nice touch for added peace of mind.Another bonus is the pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office 2021, so I was ready to work right out of the box. The inclusion of 15 months of McAfee security is a nice plus, especially if you're cautious about online threats.If I had to nitpick, 8GB of RAM is decent for everyday tasks but may not be enough for more intensive work or gaming. Also, the build, while durable, does attract fingerprints, especially on the black finish.Overall, this is an excellent laptop for students, professionals, or anyone needing a reliable machine for daily use without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for its performance, portability, and value!;As soon as the 1year warranty period is over the laptop stopped working. It gets hanged or dropped out when I'm in a meeting. Also it gets hanged when I'm trying to open an excell or any file. I've been trying to reach the customer support as well but they don't take you call or respond to message. Worst customer service and worst product. Please don't buy it.;;Worth buying this, thx.;Fear that...it may blast;nice;I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare. Right out of the box, there was a glaring green dot on the screen that refuses to go away, and the camera is unstable, making it impossible to use for work or meetings.I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to help. When I contacted Dell, their so-called \"support\" team told me they could only replace the LED/ED screen and couldn\u2019t even provide me with a DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter. How does that even make sense for a brand-new product?I trusted Amazon and Dell to deliver a quality product and back it up with proper service, but I\u2019ve been left stuck in the middle with no solution. Both companies are shirking their responsibilities, and now I\u2019m stuck with a defective laptop.This is unacceptable from two major companies that are supposed to be industry leaders. I will think twice before purchasing anything from Amazon or Dell again. Buyers beware! Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.;light weight, good portability, decent looks , good built quality, battery lasts 5-6 hrs for normal use , lasts 8 hrs on battery saver mode if you do light works .  All well except one  issue that is it starts lagging /stuttering, videos get hung if you use the laptop while charging due to overheating . But this problem is solved by using better cooling solution like using laptop bottom riser while charging. Dont forget to buy a laptop riser along with this product.",

                "text": "There were some initial hiccups (black screen) after first windows update ..video driver, bios etc. were outdated and had to be updated from the Dell support site.  Had to uninstall windows updates (using task manager) to fix black screen. Once drivers were all updated everything including windows 10 works great! Screen quality, speed and layout is nice...light to carry.  Audio speaker are not the greatest quality but acceptable enough.  Battery lasts a few hours  Overall happy with purchase...great value for around 250 dollars.;The PC itself is good but the vendor has unknowingly or deliberately messed up the refurbishment. The keyboard is completely rubbish. The second row of keys from the top (with numbers) and symbols are mis-matched. Specifically,  keys with numerals 6 onwards have symbols on them that are not seen on any standard keyboard. For example key 6 has the symbol & whereas in a standard key 6 comes with the symbol ^All the keys after 6 have this issue as also symbol keys near the ENTER key and shift key on the right hand side of the keyboard.I am surprised that anyone in their right mind would sell such a PC.Amazon has very kindly agreed to replace but I strongly suspect it will have the same issue. Keep tuned!!UPDATEThe replacement arrived today and within 10 minutes decided to return it. The keyboard was right but System properties showed that the OS was Windows 10 Home instead of Windows 10 ProI would highly recommend not to buy anything from the vendor USEDBUTNEW. Either he is unqualified to refurbish or is doing this deliberately, selling bad PCs.;The media could not be loaded.Alright Guys it's really Hard to know things about a machine in 1-2 days But still if you reading this means you really need an advice.# i bought this Renewed laptop few days back and First product i got wasn't working quite well. So i called technician visit through amazon that too 2 times and guys \"\"\" Amazon technicians  Do Not come instead  they'll want you to lie with customer support. They are worthless. Then i raise complaint with Amazon.AMAZON CUSTOMER SUPPORT Always maintain it's standards and services. they helped me getting a replacement from SYNTRONICS OFFICIAL (seller).I got almost new like laptop Dell e5470 latitude with better Processor i5 6th gen 6440HQ with windows 11 pro and charger. But it was inconvenient why couldn't they send me this one in the first time.Points to remember ---1--- Always look for a good seller (most important)  Search it or do some R&D2-- Use the product even if you don't have to. because then only you would know if there's any problem.3--- Do Not rely on Technician complaint raised by amazon because they'll not do any good. Use amazon customer support instead.4- You may get a used laptop like really used . watch for it.5- it's my first renewed product after replacement i am satisfied so far.6-- Keep one thing in mind if the laptop stops working or showing any symptoms of that after 7 days so you'll have to fix it on your own because i don't they will send someone who could fix it this warranty n all that may not work for you.7--- You have 7 days to judge the product. after that you're on your own almost. (i ordered technical visit 2 times no one came)8- Guys it's worth a shot but for those like me (risk takers)PERFORMANCE---1-- really nice,  this latitude laptop will not disappoint you2-  fine browsing, speed, no heat at all, heavy business work, daily things and rendering also covered.3-- performance wise no complaint so far with REPLACEMENT ONE\"4- Everything is original.5-- Screen is really good man..6- this is much much better that those 40k 45k laptops only if you get a fine condition product. litlt luck required.7-- Camara is fine , display awesome, processor powerful8-- i got it for 24k somthing.9- you can't ask much if you get a fine condition laptop in the first time.10-- LOOK FOR THE SELLER PLEASE. Do not order unless you trust the seller. I am thankful to Amazon customer support they helped me get a fine condition laptop.Conclusion ---Wanna save the money, you gotta take a little pain and risk. Make your mind first.;Hi! I am writing this review after using laptop for many days. It was very good like new. However it was painted and it has heating issue which I think is not a manufacturing defect. I went for a good rated seller however it cost me a little higher but was worth it.;I purchased this Laptop from Seller \"UsedbutNew\" on 21.03.24 with 6 Months Warranty. I started facing issues with the Laptop for Keyboard and Display and wrong to Seller on 29th June, subsequently provided all the documents like Invoice, Laptop Sr No, Video and photos of the problem faced but seller did not solve the issue.  Seller has provided poor quality product which does' not last even 6 months and they don't provide any post sales service even they commit for 6 month's Warranty.;The Refurbished Dell Latitude E5470 with an Intel Core i5 6th Gen. 6200u processor delivers a commendable performance for its price. The 14.1-inch HD screen provides crisp visuals, and the 8 GB RAM coupled with a 256 GB SSD ensures swift multitasking and quick boot times. Running on Windows 10 Pro adds to its versatility. Weighing just 1.71 kg, it's portable without compromising on power. While being a refurbished model, its reliability shines through, making it an excellent choice for budget-conscious users seeking a reliable workhorse for everyday tasks. Overall, a smart investment in performance and value.",

                "text": "The Dell Inspiron 5440 is a budget-friendly, mid-range laptop ideal for daily tasks like web browsing, word processing, and light media consumption. It offers good performance with Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and SSD storage, making it suitable for light multitasking and moderate workloads. The design is sleek and portable, with a solid build and comfortable keyboard. The 14-inch Full HD display is decent for indoor use, though not as vibrant as premium models. The battery lasts 6 to 8 hours on a full charge, depending on usage. It offers a variety of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and Ethernet, plus Wi-Fi 6 for fast connectivity. The audio quality is fine for casual use but lacks depth. Overall, the Inspiron 5440 offers great value for users needing a reliable laptop for everyday tasks, though it\u2019s not suited for intensive gaming or content creation.;Amazon customer care responded but we have to be on roads in traffic up and down but no solution;Delivered product specifications are not maching with what they advertising.;The Dell Inspiron 5440 is a mid-range laptop that provides solid performance for daily computing tasks, making it a great option for users looking for a reliable, budget-friendly device. Here's a detailed review of its features:Performance:The Dell Inspiron 5440 typically comes with a range of processors, including Intel Core i5 or Core i7, which offer solid performance for most everyday tasks like web browsing, word processing, spreadsheets, and media consumption. The laptop is also suitable for light multitasking and light media editing. While it\u2019s not a high-performance machine for gaming or intensive content creation (like video editing), it can handle casual gaming at low to medium settings and moderate workloads without significant slowdowns.Depending on the configuration, you might also get 8GB or 16GB RAM, which provides smooth multitasking, and 256GB or 512GB SSD options for faster boot times and quick file access. For most users, this setup is more than enough for daily productivity and light entertainment.Design & Build Quality:The Dell Inspiron 5440 has a clean, modern design with a plastic chassis and metal accents. The build is solid for its price range, but it doesn\u2019t have the premium feel of higher-end models like the XPS series. It\u2019s relatively lightweight and portable, weighing around 1.5 to 1.7 kg, making it convenient for students or professionals who need a laptop for work or on-the-go tasks.The keyboard is comfortable for typing, with well-spaced keys and decent travel, while the trackpad is responsive and supports multi-touch gestures.Display:The 14-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) display provides decent clarity and sharpness for work tasks, media consumption, and browsing. The color accuracy and brightness are generally good for indoor use, but it may fall short in direct sunlight or bright environments. For most users, it offers a solid viewing experience for typical usage, but it's not as vibrant as the displays found in more premium models.Battery Life:The battery life on the Inspiron 5440 is typically good for a full day of light office tasks, with an estimated 6 to 8 hours of use on a full charge. This will depend on the specific configuration and your usage, but it's generally reliable enough for most users. For more intensive tasks like video streaming or gaming, the battery will drain faster.Ports & Connectivity:The Dell Inspiron 5440 offers a variety of useful ports, including:USB-A (2.0 and 3.0)USB-CHDMI (for connecting to external monitors)Ethernet port (for wired internet connection)SD card reader (helpful for transferring photos or files)Headphone jackThese ports make it versatile for connecting external devices like storage drives, monitors, or headphones.The laptop also offers Wi-Fi 6 for faster internet connectivity and Bluetooth for wireless accessories.Sound:The audio quality is decent for casual media consumption. The built-in speakers are fine for video calls or listening to music in a quiet environment, but they lack depth and bass. For more immersive audio experiences, you might want to use headphones or external speakers.Overall Value:The Dell Inspiron 5440 is a great value laptop for users who need a dependable device for everyday tasks like browsing, word processing, light media consumption, and light productivity. It offers good performance for the price, solid build quality, and long battery life, making it an excellent choice for students, remote workers, and budget-conscious professionals.Final Thoughts:If you\u2019re looking for a reliable laptop that covers all the basics and offers decent performance without a high price tag, the Dell Inspiron 5440 is a solid choice. It\u2019s not a powerhouse for gaming or intensive creative work, but it offers good value for money with a reliable design, solid battery life, and satisfactory performance for everyday tasks.;Recently, I have purchased a dell laptop model inspiron 5440 (intel core 7 processor) from dell online store. I would like to share my experience.I would never suggest any one to buy Dell laptop. I have heard before from my friends that Dell laptops are not good, you should never buy them. But, i did not listen to them and purchased this laptop spending a huge sum. I must tell you, the initial one was pathetic. I was facing one issue after another.They call it thin an light model, but its fan never stop rotating. I have seen so many laptop with similar price range. At least for non of the them, the fan makes these loud noise. Thus i tried contacting dell technical support. They told me, mam, for this model the fan will make this loud noise. There is no solution to it. After that, they remotely installed some software.Next, i faced speaker issue. There was no sound coming out of my laptop. Again i contacted the dell technical team, they did some thing and it was working fine. But at the same time laptop became slow.So the technical expert next reset my pc. She was suggesting me to reinstall the operating system also. I told her, it has been only 5 days i bought this laptop, is it necessary.Now also when i am writing this review, my fan keeps on rotating.I, being from a middle class family, spend our hard earned money, to buy a good laptop for study purchase. But, i realized now, i have lost a huge sum of  money by spending it on this laptop.Dell website says , you can return our product in 14 days if you don't like it. But their technical support person says neither we will replace it nor you can return it. That means \"Even if you got a defective piece you should keep it\".I can not get back my money. But at least you should not spend a penny on this useless dell product. I hope my review helps you to make better judgment regarding purchase of dell product. My personal suggestion is please don't buy it.  I have been on so much mental stress these days because of the amount of money i spent on this product. And the inspiron 5440 turns out to be total waste;This laptop performs something in between the apple M1 and M2 chip air models. Can do the processor intensive tasks easily but gaming obviously suffers since it is a professional laptop.",

                "text": "I am writing this review after one month of use. I received this product on 13th April 2024. I received this product like new without any scratch so Thank you @Amazone and seller @Used Yet New.I am using as a home server, so it is running 24*7 did not find any issue till now. I get this pc with activated window 11 and MS Office and working fine with window 11.Currently I am using ubuntu 24.04 and it is also working fine with Linux OS.  I have hosted NextCloud, Jellyfin Media server, MySQL and also many web sites. And parallelly I am also using this for development with VSCode and watch YouTube videos.;Working Condition is good also Support teamhappy With the service;- Bad SSD: Comes with \"Consistent\" brand 512GB ssd that failed within just two days. Unexpected for dell to use such low quality ssd.- Bad power adapter: Turns off randomly during load- Bad video outputs: Two display ports and only one of them works with VGA- Bad usb: Can hardly power 3 devices without power adapter turning system off- OEM locked power input: It's so bad that even genuine one is rejected as fake, CPU performance is throttled to lowest;So far so good.....it's just been the 3rd day, I am using it.....the packing was perfect as was the delivery experience.....The system is absolutely as it has been described..... boots super fast, 16 GB RAM and 512 SSD comes handy...... Windows 11 was pre installed and is an original version, although MS Office was a trial version and wasn't activated.....was lucky as I had a MS Office subscription.....WIFI and Bluetooth card wasn't installed, rather only a wifi USB dongle was provided.....so had to purchase a Bluetooth dongle as well, display has inbuilt Intel UHD which hadles day to day work well. the BIOS wasn't updated, had to update that..... original charger has been provided......let's hope that it works well in the long run......Cheers.After 6 days had to reinstall Windows as it kept continuously crashing......;Good performance.Came with Windows 11 Pro and Office 2019 Pro Plus activated. Both are updating normally, so there is no issue of counterfeit software.Ordered for the 16 GB model, but received 8 GB one. Already escalated to Amazon and seller. Waiting for resolution/ action (day 3).The SSD provided is an unbranded one, literally. Neither Windows nor Linux can identify it's make/ model!Has inbuilt Wifi & Bluetooth which was a pleasant surprise.Lastly it is 3070 model and not 3060 (at least the one I received).The CPU is in practically mint condition, adopter is also original Dell.Update: God the replacement after 4 days from raising the issue. This time it finally had 16 GB RAM but the Wifi/BT card was not there. However since this is not mentioned in specs, I believe you can have your fingers crossed (whether you will get it or not). Also the model was 3060.;Update Feb 2024 - Down to 3 stars (Previously rated 5)The PC boot up and performance is slower vs my other systems with SATA SSDs; I strongly believe the cause is this specific SSD (although health looks fine). If you unfortunately happen to get a \u201cPowerX\u201d SSD, performance will be subpar vs the standard. So it is recommended to pay extra and get a new one if you have the budget.-----All specs as advertised - 16GB RAM + a 512GB PowerX SATA SSD @ 100% health in CrystalDiskInfo. Personally would recommend this over the Optiplex 3070 as the only difference is 1 generation gap and an in-built Wifi adaptor. Free RAM slot and SATA M.2 slot as well.I had a \u20b9200 TP-Link Wifi card so was covered on that end.Did not test for gaming/editing nor do I intend to - this is a PC built for office use case.A price under 15k in 2023 is good enough. Perfect office PC.;This refurbished Dell optiplex 3060 tiny desktop is a very good model. I recommend this for those interested in using desktop. This model of the mini desktop is very recent one. It is comfortable to use and doesn't occupy space. It works quite well. Further in case you buy from the seller UYN, it would in all probability look new in appearance and you would be pleased.;I like the form factor, Value for money, it\u2019s 8th Gen Processor with 4 cores supports which supports Windows 11 works with no issues using it for basic Tally and Excel, support was prompt, to access WiFi a separate dongle is provided WiFi is not in built in Motherboard, further to my surprise in this small package you will get a decent audio playback through a speaker",

                "text": "I recently purchased the Dell 15 Thin & Light Laptop, and so far, I'm quite impressed. It packs a Core i5-1235U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, which makes multitasking smooth and quick. The 15.6\" FHD display is sharp and offers great visuals whether I'm streaming videos or working on documents.What stands out for me is how lightweight it is\u2014just 1.66kg\u2014making it super portable without feeling flimsy. Despite its slim design, the laptop feels sturdy, and the spill-resistant keyboard is a nice touch for added peace of mind.Another bonus is the pre-installed Windows 11 and MS Office 2021, so I was ready to work right out of the box. The inclusion of 15 months of McAfee security is a nice plus, especially if you're cautious about online threats.If I had to nitpick, 8GB of RAM is decent for everyday tasks but may not be enough for more intensive work or gaming. Also, the build, while durable, does attract fingerprints, especially on the black finish.Overall, this is an excellent laptop for students, professionals, or anyone needing a reliable machine for daily use without breaking the bank. Highly recommended for its performance, portability, and value!;As soon as the 1year warranty period is over the laptop stopped working. It gets hanged or dropped out when I'm in a meeting. Also it gets hanged when I'm trying to open an excell or any file. I've been trying to reach the customer support as well but they don't take you call or respond to message. Worst customer service and worst product. Please don't buy it.;;Worth buying this, thx.;Fear that...it may blast;nice;I purchased this laptop expecting reliability, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare. Right out of the box, there was a glaring green dot on the screen that refuses to go away, and the camera is unstable, making it impossible to use for work or meetings.I immediately reached out to Amazon for a replacement, but they refused to help. When I contacted Dell, their so-called \"support\" team told me they could only replace the LED/ED screen and couldn\u2019t even provide me with a DOA (Dead on Arrival) letter. How does that even make sense for a brand-new product?I trusted Amazon and Dell to deliver a quality product and back it up with proper service, but I\u2019ve been left stuck in the middle with no solution. Both companies are shirking their responsibilities, and now I\u2019m stuck with a defective laptop.This is unacceptable from two major companies that are supposed to be industry leaders. I will think twice before purchasing anything from Amazon or Dell again. Buyers beware! Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did.;light weight, good portability, decent looks , good built quality, battery lasts 5-6 hrs for normal use , lasts 8 hrs on battery saver mode if you do light works .  All well except one  issue that is it starts lagging /stuttering, videos get hung if you use the laptop while charging due to overheating . But this problem is solved by using better cooling solution like using laptop bottom riser while charging. Dont forget to buy a laptop riser along with this product.",

I primarily use this laptop for trading, watching movies, and general productivity tasks, and it has proven to be more than capable for all my needs.**Performance and Display:**Equipped with an Intel 12th Gen Core i3 processor and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop delivers smooth and responsive performance, even when multitasking between multiple applications. The 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a stunning visual experience, making movies come to life and enhancing the fluidity of my trading charts.**Portability and Build Quality:**Weighing just 1.69kg and featuring a thin and lightweight design, the Dell 15 is easy to carry around, whether I'm working from home or on the go. The spill-resistant keyboard adds a layer of durability, giving me peace of mind against accidental spills during long trading sessions or movie marathons.**Value for Money:**At a price of 29k, this laptop offers exceptional value for money. With its solid performance, vibrant display, and practical features, it competes favorably with higher-priced alternatives on the market. For a first-time laptop buyer like myself, it's reassuring to know that I've made a wise investment in a reliable and versatile computing device.**Future Updates:**I plan to update this review after six months of using the Dell 15, providing valuable insights into its long-term performance, durability, and any additional features or drawbacks I may discover over time. This will be helpful for others who are considering purchasing the same laptop and are looking for real-world experiences.**Final Thoughts:**Overall, the Dell 15 has been an outstanding first laptop for me. Its combination of performance, display quality, portability, and affordability makes it an ideal choice for users looking for a versatile companion for everyday computing tasks. Whether you're a student, professional, or casual user, the Dell 15 delivers a compelling user experience that punches above its price point. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for their first laptop or a reliable upgrade.Edit: today 7 September 2024 my hinges broked but because of dell service they replaced my hinges and laptop upper body \ud83d\udc45 , Hinges were hard and after replacement they're very smooth like Amul butter. Zero rupees replacement! Just call customer care and told everything! Within 2 days engineer visit and fixed it!, check my images and videos.Overall laptop is great \ud83d\ude38! I bought this laptop only 29k because of credit card discount..;I ordered this laptop and I had received old and used laptop in open box. Orignal box was open which was kept inside good amazon outer box, so I couldn't check open box while taking laptop delivery. See below issues that I faced and need your attention so that you save your money.Open box, used laptopI order 14\" laptop and received 15.9\" display.It was getting Heat too much in this cold winter weather.When pressed power switch thrice it turns on.Some times there is black screen and only cursor visible. Twice it happened.Faulty product, was looking like refurbished computer.This seller is selling faulty product. Be aware. It's good to buy from local shop.Configuration is same as described.There are 21% , 1star review;Over all good product, Battery exhaust fast.;The media could not be loaded.It Is Very Ideal For Work And Without Lagging. Very Handy To Use, Feels Like A Book & Is Light. Very Clear Display. Very Satisfied From Amazon. We Were Initially Worried About Quality But It Is The Best By Value.You Can Go For It For Office Working. Used For 4 Hours 100% to 15% In Full Use.;Received my system on 27th February, Completed system configuration, yet to start using.Positive - Received in company (Dell) packing, and Amazon box on top of it, lot of protection inside, brand new piece, verily slim look \u2026 Overall look and feel is Brilliant\u2026Shall write more about performance once I start using itThanks everyone for your attention;I purchased this laptop on the 18th and today is the 24th. I have read a lot of reviews complaining about heating issues and yes they are right. This laptop is a heater. It will be very helpful during the winter season.But I am keeping this as I have liked it and that's why the good 3 stars I am giving.When you use any laptop for the first few days, it heats up pretty badly because of a lot of updates going on in the background. I was almost scared when I see it heats up super bad and was thinking to return it. But that was just one time. But still, it heats up more than a normal laptop should. I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work. I just purchased it as a backup laptop because my main laptop Asus Vivobook runs 14 to 18hrs a day for the last 5 yrs and it needs some rest.Personally, I won't recommend this laptop. Maybe try Asus or HP. Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though. Will update after 4-5 months of usage and re-write proper review after 1 year of usageEdit: 21st August 2024.Well, on 14th August, 2024, laptop stopped working. I sent it to Dell repair and found motherboard is dead. They need to replace it whole.So I am not recommending this laptop. People say right. Never bought expensive stuffs online. This is 4th laptop and 1st online and so huge issue. Motherboard estimation is 16500 right now. Luckily I have insurance, I am not sure how much will they cover. My Asus, HP, Compaq and Macbook never got motherboard issue and all lasted long. This one gave so big issues even from start and now look at it.",

                "text": "Purchased from TPS Technologies. The package is received in extra cartoon consisting of manufacturer sealed original package and complementary input power cable. Further,  the item is in  a polyethylene bag with tamper proof seal , inside the original package,. It is manufactured in July 2021. The net weight without complementary input power cable is 485 gms. All the descriptios on labels are correlating. So I believe it's new and genuine Dell.The performance and safety standard are excellent based on the following parameters,Open circuit DC voltage is 19.7V. There is no AC Voltage and no leakage current at output, hence it is safe from any electrical shock at output pin. It is able to drive MSI Gaming laptop of rating 150w , (19.5V , DC jack of size 7.4mm OD X 5.0mm ID) without any overcurrent protection acting (unlike 90W charger). I am using it even for tpa3116d2 amplifier through a adapter cable (as it's 24V DC adapter is having a leakage current of 0.07A at AC voltage of 70V). The quality / reliability of unbranded complementary input power cable is not known as i have started using MSI OEM supplied old cable (instead of opening the bag of above free cable).However, In view of recent experiencces of other users , i will check it suitably before put into use and update.Testing a cord is a specialist job. The supplied cord is of unbranded as  per uplaoded photo. (The cord I am using of MSI laptop, but it is of make I-SHENG). It is better to purchase a branded Dell or its marketed Volex or Storite make (connector type is Mickey i.e C5)Update as on 02.10.2022. it is working great , more than a year is over.;Never buy this product. 1st day of working issue. Charger is turning off automatically even though it is connected with electrical supply.;I\u2019ve been using for almost 3 months and It\u2019s working perfectly fine. It just gets heat up a little but the original one did so too. Overall a best deal.;GUYS DONT BUY THIS CHARGER IT STARTED TO LITERALLY BURN !!!i bought this charger in April 2021 and it was working fine till today on 20th September 2021 when the plug part of the charger started burning from inside and started to smoke. Thank God i was home and using my laptop at that time otherwise my whole house would have been burnt down. Forget about your laptop guys this thing can literally cost you your life.Guys please don't buy this i sincerely request you and I'm not kidding at all!;Proper charger and original Fitted well;When i plugged in the charger, i saw smoke coming from the power cable and now it's not working. It hasn't  been a year yet? Does the 1 year warranty cover this damage? How do i proceed now?;Those who are telling the product does not work or is bad for any reasons ....... Screw them its the best product the cable quality is even better than orignal;I bought the item 3 months back. It was working well until today. I wasn't worried much because it is well within the warranty period. When I messaged the seller regarding replacement, they told to contact the brand service center. I then approached the brand service center and they downright refused to replace products bought from amazon. So I am stuck with a useless product with no support.;The OEM charger crapped out after a couple of years, so hope this one works better.;As described;The Power supply worked great.;Great product.  Works perfectly.",

                "text": "Review for Charger Model - PS-U-65W - 65W Universal Laptop AdapterThe charger does its job well.I am using it for nearly 1 week now to charge my Acer Aspire A515-51 laptop, after the original charger developed a loose connection issue and it eventually died.Observations:1. Box Packing is good2. Multiple adapters are provided to fit into your desired laptop model (see attached photo).3. I used the 19v P7 adapter which fits into my laptop charger port. It does not fit tight, there is a slight left-right movement, although it is not loose either.4. It is a 65 W charger (same as my original, I had checked before buying this one)5. Charging time is approx. 1 hr to reach 100% from battery low indicator warning (30% in my case)6. A blue light indicator lights up after a second or two when it is switched on. I think there is inbuilt delay to turn on the charger for protection.7. Heats up while charging, which I think is normal.8. It seems to be capable of multiple voltages - 5v/9v/12v/15v/18.5v/19v/19.5v/20v. This might be based on the adapter plug used or automatic, but I have not tried it on other devices. Be careful of over-voltage burnout when using this feature.Hope this review helped you!Thanks for reading!;I used it extra carefully knowing its a make shift charger and had no issues with it, but suddenly the tip of the type c charger came off while charging my laptop. Such poor build quality, totally useless.;The product is genuine and is value for money. Eight pins are there.However for my ASUS laptop model the compatible pin is a little lose (Not fully fits the female). Despite that charging is fine. And sing other 7 pins are there that I can use for other laptops so, value for money wise the product is excellent in the long term. The length of the cord is also appropriate. One should note that the original ASUS AC adapter has very short chord, and is very \"tender\".This product on the other hand is sturdy, has LED indicator also.One more thing, I received the Ru2k charger of ASUS from a shopkeeper in Rs 2400, However this universal AC adapter has MRP of 2190, but is available on Amazon in just 999, that too with delivery in just 2 days!.Now, one can understand why Amazon is better.Excellent product!;If you are one of the old laptop owners that own non gaming laptops this one's for you.I have 2 of these, the benefit I get if I have any visitor along that has forgotten their charger, all I have to do is change the tip as per their laptop and they can charge their laptop easily.Pros1. Easy to change tip2. 65 watts which covers all basic laptopsCons1. Not for gaming laptops as they usually require 90watts or above2. The tips become loose over the periodJust make sure you check your existing laptops charger rating that is printed over the charger itself and below 65 watts this charger will do the job.;Packaging is good but quality is decent;Universal Laptop connector - thanks to Amazon Prime... Delivered in 13 hours!,Product impressive but slow charging with Type C charger, Laptop says slow chargingPS- When you travel without a laptop charger. Life saver Amazon\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\u270c\ud83c\udffb;Dont buy. Missleading specs. Bought charger for ASUS laptop but the pin is not fitting properly and the laptop is not charging.;I recently purchased the 65W Universal Laptop Adapter, and it has truly exceeded my expectations. This adapter comes with eight interchangeable connector pins, making it compatible with a wide range of brands like Dell, HP, Lenovo, ASUS, Acer, Samsung, Compaq, and IBM. The versatility is a game changer, allowing me to charge multiple devices without the need for several chargers cluttering my workspace.The build quality is impressive\u2014sturdy yet lightweight, making it easy to carry around. The included power cord is a nice touch, ensuring I have everything I need right out of the box. I also appreciate the sleek design, which fits well with modern laptops and doesn\u2019t look out of place on my desk.Performance-wise, the charging speed is fantastic. I\u2019ve noticed that my laptop charges quickly and efficiently, which is essential for someone always on the go. The safety features provide peace of mind, preventing overheating and ensuring stable power delivery.Overall, the 65W Universal Laptop Adapter is an essential accessory for anyone looking for a reliable and efficient charging solution. Highly recommended for students, professionals, or anyone with multiple devices!",

Originality confirmed with barcode.Specification:Input Voltage: 100-240 volts;Frequency: 50/60 Hz;Voltage: 19.5 volts;Current: 4.62 amps;Color: Black;Weight: 222 gms.It came with 1.8 Mtr cable which makes it even more comfortable to use.Got a discount of 40 %, along with 1 Year Warranty.  Currently the charger serves its purpose, but I shall come & update the review in case I face any issues.So, for now I highly recommend the product and appreciate delivery services by Amazon.;Very good product i don't know that is genuine or not but that is working without any problem;Nice product. Comes in dell sealed box. Orignal product. Satisfied with the quality. Go for it if you need it for dell n 5000 series. I bought it for dell n5110;I was bit skeptical while ordering charger for my DELL laptop as I was looking for genuine charger without any cheating by the seller. After thorough research on Amazon I finally decided to place my order through this seller seeing good reviews and max number of reviews although still I was bit scared on the quality of product which I am going to receive. To my surprise it was brand new DELL genuine charger in original packing.Its sleek 90w charger with good design, nice LED light and good power output/charging performance and that too in just 1599. What else would you ask for ??;Purchased this product in Sep'2019 through Amazon (Seller - SP Infotech). It stopped working today (13 July'2020), I reported the same to Dell customer care and they tracked the ID of the charger and found out it was manufactured 5 years ago which was the reason it failed to work in less than a year after my purchase.Also, it was mentioned on Amazon that it comes with 1 year Warranty but now they are saying the warranty was for 3 months only.Really disappointed with the purchase.;Working fine but it's don't look like a original Dell product, although it's come with Original packing,Cable of the adapter was shorter.Charging time was fine till now it takes 1-1.30 hours to fully charge my laptop, which is I think normal. .;acha adapter hai very useful;Compatible with my dell inspiron 14z laptop",
